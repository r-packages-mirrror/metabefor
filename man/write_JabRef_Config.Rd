\arguments{
\item{outputPath}{The path to write the file(s) to.}

\item{screeners}{The strings to use to identify the screeners.}

\item{screenerFieldsPrefix, screenerFieldsSuffix}{The prefix and suffix to
attach to the screener identification strings to create the fields where
the screeners store their decision.}

\item{screenerConfidencePrefix, screenerConfidenceSuffix}{The prefix and
suffix to attach to the screener identification strings to create the
fields where the screeners store their confidence in their decision.}

\item{fields}{The fields that have to be screened.}

\item{duplicateField}{The field}

\item{sortField}{The field to sort entries by.}

\item{sortDesc}{Whether to sort in descending or ascending order.}

\item{screeningType}{The type of screening (added to the filenames).}

\item{jabrefVersion}{The version of JabRef to format the configuration file
for.}

\item{jabrefXML}{Optionally, the path to a file with a jabrefXML 'skeleton',
in which certain, as yet undocumented, replacements will be made (but you
can check the source code of the function in the meantime).}

\item{batFile}{Optionally, contents of the batch file to write.}

\item{generateSettingRemovalBatchFile}{Whether to write a batch file that
edits the Windows registry to remove JabRef configuration, which may
sometimes be necessary to get JabRef to use the XML configuration file.}

a suffix to the file that is written.}

\value{
Invisibly, an object with the configuration file and intermediate
steps.

\description{
This function writes one or more JabRef configuration files that set
a number of fields to be visible to screeners, so that you can mask the
screeners from fields like journal, authors, and publication year.

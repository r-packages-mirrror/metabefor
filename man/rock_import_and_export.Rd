\title{Export an entity to ROCK format and import it back into the Rxs object}
\usage{
rxs_export_to_rock(
  x,
  entityId = NULL,
  outputFile = NULL,
  rxsEntityId = metabefor::opts$get("rockInterfacing_rxsEntityId"),
  rxsSourceId = metabefor::opts$get("rockInterfacing_rxsSourceId")
)

rxs_import_from_rock(
  rxs,
  input = NULL,
  filenameRegex = NULL,
  rxsSourceId = metabefor::opts$get("rockInterfacing_rxsSourceId"),
  rxsEntityId = metabefor::opts$get("rockInterfacing_rxsEntityId")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The Rxs object, either an Rxs project (as produced
by \code{\link[=rxs_parseExtractionScripts]{rxs_parseExtractionScripts()}}) or a single Rxs
extraction tree, to export from or merge into.}

\item{entityId}{The identifier of the entity to create a source for.}

\item{outputFile}{Optionally, a file to write the source to. If no
file is specified, the resulting character vector will be returned
visibly (if an output file \emph{is} specified, it will be returned invisibly).}

\item{rxsEntityId, rxsSourceId}{The class instance identifiers to use in
the ROCK source to identify instances of the 'entity' and 'source' classes.
Note that source here refers to a source in the systematic review, i.e. an
Rxs tree; not to be confused with a ROCK source (i.e. a plain text file
with one or more data fragments to code).}
}
\value{
The ROCK source as a character vector, invisibly, unless
an \code{outputFile} is specified for \code{metabefor::rxs_export_to_rock()}. However,
note that \code{metabefor::rxs_import_from_rock()} also modifies the Rxs object
in place (based on the "pass by reference" logic used by \code{data.tree}).
}
\description{
The Reproducible Open Coding Kit (ROCK) format is a format for
open and transparent storage and analysis of qualitative data. In
systematic reviews, you often want to extract an entity as raw text,
so that you can apply a structured coding procedure to the raw text
fragments without exposing the coders to other extracted information (to
minimize bias). By exporting these entities to the ROCK format, the
regular workflows used for qualitative research can be used, after which
the coded sources can be imported back into \code{metabefor} and merged with
the Rxs project.

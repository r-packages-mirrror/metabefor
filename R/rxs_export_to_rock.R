#' Export an entity to ROCK format and import it back into the Rxs object
#' 
#' The Reproducible Open Coding Kit (ROCK) format is a format for
#' open and transparent storage and analysis of qualitative data. In
#' systematic reviews, you often want to extract an entity as raw text,
#' so that you can apply a structured coding procedure to the raw text
#' fragments without exposing the coders to other extracted information (to
#' minimize bias). By exporting these entities to the ROCK format, the
#' regular workflows used for qualitative research can be used, after which
#' the coded sources can be imported back into `metabefor` and merged with
#' the Rxs project.
#'
#' @param rxs The Rxs object, either an Rxs project (as produced
#' by [metabefor::rxs_parseExtractionScripts()]) or a single Rxs
#' extraction tree, to export from or merge into.
#' @param entityId The identifier of the entity to create a source for.
#' @param rxsEntityId,rxsSourceId The class instance identifiers to use in
#' the ROCK source to identify instances of the 'entity' and 'source' classes.
#' Note that source here refers to a source in the systematic review, i.e. an
#' Rxs tree; not to be confused with a ROCK source (i.e. a plain text file
#' with one or more data fragments to code).
#' @param outputFile Optionally, a file to write the source to. If no
#' file is specified, the resulting character vector will be returned
#' visibly (if an output file _is_ specified, it will be returned invisibly).
#'
#' @return The ROCK source as a character vector, invisibly, unless
#' an `outputFile` is specified for `metabefor::rxs_export_to_rock()`. However,
#' note that `metabefor::rxs_import_from_rock()` also modifies the Rxs object
#' in place (based on the "pass by reference" logic used by `data.tree`).

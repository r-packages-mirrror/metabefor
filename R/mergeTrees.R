#' Merge two Rxs trees (`data.tree` nodes)
#' 
#' Note this this function is used internally and was written to merge Rxs
#' trees (hence the name), so it may not fit other use cases: for example,
#' when merging two leaf nodes with the same name and path, if the `value`
#' attribute is a list, those lists are combined using [base::c()].
#'
#' @param tree1,tree2 The trees to merge.
#'
#' @return The merged tree, a (cloned) `data.tree` `Node` object.

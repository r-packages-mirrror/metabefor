<!--------------------------------------------->

The goal of metabefor is to help design and execute transparant,
reproducible, extensible, scalable, and machine-readable systematic
reviews, mostly supporting the screening and extraction stages.
Originally, the package was intended to help with everything that needs
to be done before the [metafor](https://metafor-project.org) package can
be used, hence the name. Since then, the
[metaverse](https://rmetaverse.github.io/) was born, with dedicated
packages for specific stages, such as developing search strategies,
working with bibliographic data, and visualisation.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `metabefor` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages('metabefor');
```

You can install the development version of `metabefor` from
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) with:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/metabefor');
```

(assuming you have `remotes` installed; otherwise, install that first
using the `install.packages` function)

You can install the cutting edge development version (own risk, donâ€™t
try this at home, etc) of `metabefor` from
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) with:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/metabefor@dev');
```

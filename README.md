# metabefor

The goal of metabefor is to help with the process of a systematic review
and potentially meta-analysis, specifically with all tasks before the
actual meta-analysis. In a sense, this package helps with everything
that needs to be done before metafor can be used, hence the name.

Itâ€™s name is derived from the brilliant R package for quantitative
synthesis [metafor](https://metafor-project.org).

Description: In systematic reviews, extracting data from primary
             sources is a crucial step with a high potential for
             introduction of biases. This package facilitates
             specification of R extraction scripts that are
             simultaneously human- and machine-readable. In
             addition, they are modular and extensible, lending
             themselves well to living reviews where insights as
             to optimal extraction evolve over time. By being R
             Markdown script files, they are optimally transparant,
             and their structure was designed to also be accessible
             to readers without R. Finally, each extraction script
             contains the original specification, enabling
             bootstrapping new specifications from each single
             extraction script.

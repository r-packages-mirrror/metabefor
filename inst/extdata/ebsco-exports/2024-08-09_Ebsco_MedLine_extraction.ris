AB  - Data extraction is a crucial, yet labor-intensive and error-prone part of evidence synthesis. To date, efforts to harness machine learning for enhancing efficiency of the data extraction process have fallen short of achieving sufficient accuracy and usability. With the release of large language models (LLMs), new possibilities have emerged to increase efficiency and accuracy of data extraction for evidence synthesis. The objective of this proof-of-concept study was to assess the performance of an LLM (Claude 2) in extracting data elements from published studies, compared with human data extraction as employed in systematic reviews. Our analysis utilized a convenience sample of 10 English-language, open-access publications of randomized controlled trials included in a single systematic review. We selected 16 distinct types of data, posing varying degrees of difficulty (160 data elements across 10 studies). We used the browser version of Claude 2 to upload the portable document format of each publication and then prompted the model for each data element. Across 160 data elements, Claude 2 demonstrated an overall accuracy of 96.3% with a high test-retest reliability (replication 1: 96.9%; replication 2: 95.0% accuracy). Overall, Claude 2 made 6 errors on 160 data items. The most common errors (n = 4) were missed data items. Importantly, Claude 2's ease of use was high; it required no technical expertise or labeled training data for effective operation (i.e., zero-shot learning). Based on findings of our proof-of-concept study, leveraging LLMs has the potential to substantially enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data extraction for evidence syntheses.

AB  - Accurate data extraction is a key component of evidence synthesis and critical to valid results. The advent of publicly available large language models (LLMs) has generated interest in these tools for evidence synthesis and created uncertainty about the choice of LLM. We compare the performance of two widely available LLMs (Claude 2 and GPT-4) for extracting pre-specified data elements from 10 published articles included in a previously completed systematic review. We use prompts and full study PDFs to compare the outputs from the browser versions of Claude 2 and GPT-4. GPT-4 required use of a third-party plugin to upload and parse PDFs. Accuracy was high for Claude 2 (96.3%). The accuracy of GPT-4 with the plug-in was lower (68.8%); however, most of the errors were due to the plug-in. Both LLMs correctly recognized when prespecified data elements were missing from the source PDF and generated correct information for data elements that were not reported explicitly in the articles. A secondary analysis demonstrated that, when provided selected text from the PDFs, Claude 2 and GPT-4 accurately extracted 98.7% and 100% of the data elements, respectively. Limitations include the narrow scope of the study PDFs used, that prompt development was completed using only Claude 2, and that we cannot guarantee the open-source articles were not used to train the LLMs. This study highlights the potential for LLMs to revolutionize data extraction but underscores the importance of accurate PDF parsing. For now, it remains essential for a human investigator to validate LLM extractions. ((C) 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.)

AB  - Background: Data extraction is the foundation for research synthesis evidence, while data extraction errors frequently occur in the literature. An interesting phenomenon was observed that data extraction error tend to be more common in trials of pharmaceutical interventions compared to non-pharmaceutical ones. The elucidation of which would have implications for guidelines, practice, and policy.; Methods and Analyses: We propose a crossover, multicenter, investigator-blinded trial to elucidate the potential variants on the data extraction error rates. Eligible 90 participants would be 2nd year or above post-graduate students (e.g., masters, doctoral program). Participants will be randomized to one of the two groups to complete pre-defined data extraction tasks: 1) group A will contain 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmaceutical interventions; 2) group B will contain 10 RCTs of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Participants who finish the data extraction would then be assigned to the alternative group for another round of data extraction after a 30 min washout period. Finally, those participants assigned to A or B group will be further 1:1 randomly matched based on a random-sequenced number for the double-checking process on the extracted data. The primary outcome will be the data extract error rates of the pharmaceutical intervention group and non-pharmaceutical group, before the double-checking process, in terms of the cell level, study level, and participant level. The secondary outcome will be the data error rates of the pharmaceutical intervention group and non-pharmaceutical group after the double-checking process, again, in terms of the cell level, study level, and participant level. A generalized linear mixed effects model (based on the above three levels) will be used to estimate the potential differences in the error rates, with a log link function for binomial data. Subgroup analyses will account for the experience of individuals on systematic reviews and the time used for the data extraction.; Discussion: This trial will provide useful evidence for further systematic review of data extraction practices, improved data extraction strategies, and better guidelines.; Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Register Center (Identifier: ChiCTR2200062206).; Competing Interests: The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

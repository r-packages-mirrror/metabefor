AB  - The recreational drug 'ecstasy' [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)] exerts a potent action on central serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons. These neurons utilize neurotrophins for their survival and function. In order to explore MDMA effects on neurotrophins, we measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in 'ecstasy-addicted', 'ecstasy-addicted with signs of psychosis' and 'healthy' subjects. We found that BDNF serum levels were significantly increased in both groups of 'ecstasy-addicted' as compared with 'healthy subjects', supporting the hypothesis that BDNF is involved in MDMA action.

AB  - Recreational ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) use has been increasingly associated with a number of psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems. However, previous studies assessing possible psychopathological effects have not identified whether users consider their ecstasy use 'problematic' or not. In addition, research has generally failed to address the potential role of premorbid psychiatric status. This study aimed to assess whether premorbid psychiatric history and/or patterns of ecstasy use would be associated with the degree of self-reported problems attributable to ecstasy. Problematic ecstasy users (n=53) who had reported problems attributable to their ecstasy use were compared with non-problematic ecstasy users (n=62), polydrug controls (n=62) and illegal drug-naive controls (n=111) on a recreational drug use questionnaire; a questionnaire, which ascertained personal and family psychiatric histories, and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Problematic ecstasy users exhibited significantly higher scores on a number of dimensions of the BSI compared to illegal drug-naive and/or polydrug controls. Problematic ecstasy users also exhibited significantly elevated scores on somatization, depression, anxiety and negative psychobiology compared to non-problematic ecstasy users. BSI scores for the non-problematic ecstasy users did not differ from polydrug or illegal drug-naive controls. Problematic ecstasy users reported significantly higher levels of ecstasy use, including lifetime consumption, average dosage and binge consumption compared to non-problematic ecstasy users. Additionally, a greater number of problematic ecstasy users reported personal and family psychiatric histories compared to controls and non-problematic ecstasy users. This study demonstrates two distinct ecstasy using groups: non-problematic ecstasy users who are not showing signs of psychopathology and problematic ecstasy users who are showing evidence of a range of symptoms. This data therefore partially supports the link between ecstasy dosage and negative psychological sequalae, but highlights the importance of the need to consider ecstasy-related attributions, pre-existing mental health status and vulnerability.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The conceptualization of substance use disorders (SUDs) was modified in successive editions of the DSM. Dimensionality and inclusion/exclusion of several criteria was studied using various analytic approaches. Objective The study aimed to deepen our knowledge of the interrelationships between the diagnostic criteria for cocaine use disorder (CUD), applying three different analytical techniques: factor analysis, Item Response Theory (IRT) models, and network analysis. Methods 425 (85.4% male) outpatients were evaluated for CUD using the Substance Dependence Severity Scale. Confirmatory Factor Analysis, 2-parameter logistic model (IRT) and network analysis were applied to analyze the relationships between the diagnostic criteria. Results The results show that 'legal problems' criterion is not congruent with the CUD measure on three analyses. Also, network analysis suggests the usefulness of the 'craving' criterion. The criterion 'quit/control' is the one that presents the best centrality indices and expected influence, showing strong relationships with the criteria of 'craving,' 'tolerance,' 'neglect roles' and 'activities given up.' Conclusions Network analysis appears to be a useful and complementary technique to factor analysis and IRT for understanding CUD. The 'quit/control' criterion emerges as a central criterion to understand CUD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - RationaleStimulant use, including cocaine, often occurs in a social context whose influence is important to understand to decrease intake and reduce associated harms. Although the importance of social influence in the context of drug addiction is known, there is a need for studies assessing its neurobiological substrate and for translational research.ObjectivesHere, we explored the influence of peer presence and familiarity on cocaine intake and its neurobiological basis. Given the regulatory role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on cocaine intake and emotions, we investigated its role on such influence of social context on cocaine intake.MethodsWe first compared cocaine consumption in various conditions (with no peer present or with peers with different characteristics: abstinent peer or drug-taking peer, familiar or not, cocaine-naive or not, dominant or subordinate) in rats (n = 90). Then, with a translational approach, we assessed the influence of the social context (alone, in the group, in a dyad with familiar or non-familiar peers) on drug intake in human drug users (n = 77).ResultsThe drug consumption was reduced when a peer was present, abstinent, or drug-taking as well, and further diminished when the peer was non-familiar. The presence of a non-familiar and drug-naive peer represents key conditions to diminish cocaine intake. The STN lesion by itself reduced cocaine intake to the level reached in presence of a non-familiar naive peer and affected social cognition, positioning the STN as one neurobiological substrate of social influence on drug intake. Then, the human study confirmed the beneficial effect of social presence, especially of non-familiar peers.ConclusionOur results indirectly support the use of social interventions and harm reduction strategies and position the STN as a key cerebral structure to mediate these effects.

AB  - Background: Small towns in New Zealand have reported high availability of methamphetamine, and conversely a shortage of cannabis. Stakeholders have suggested drug dealers are purposely promoting methamphetamine rather than cannabis. Aims: (1) To compare the availability of methamphetamine and cannabis in different size communities; (2) Identify determinants of the high availability of methamphetamine, including low availability of cannabis. Method: An online drug survey was promoted via a broadly targeted Facebook™ campaign. Participants were asked if they lived in a 'city', 'small town' or 'rural area', their drug use patterns, and local drug market characteristics, including current availability. A total of 6311 people completed the survey. Logistic regression models were constructed to identify independent predictors of reporting high availability of methamphetamine, cannabis, ecstasy and LSD respectively, with low availability of cannabis included as a predictor in the non-cannabis markets. Results: Methamphetamine was reported to be more available than cannabis in all regions. Methamphetamine was more available in towns/rural areas than in cities. Significant predictors of high availability of methamphetamine were living in a town/rural area (OR = 1.38), purchasing from a gang member (OR = 1.88), daily methamphetamine use (OR = 2.41), Maori ethnicity (OR = 1.36) and reporting low availability of cannabis (OR = 1.89). Low availability of cannabis was not a predictor of high availability of ecstasy or LSD. Living in a town/rural area was not a predictor of high availability of cannabis, LSD or ecstasy. Purchasing from a gang member was a predictor of high availability of cannabis (OR = 1.80) and LSD (OR = 4.61). Conclusions: Further research is required to identify what causal relationships, if any, there are between the statistical associations of high methamphetamine availability, living in a small town, purchasing from a gang, and low cannabis availability. It may be the case that small towns offer an environment where a gang can control the local drugs market. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Evidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants’ Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2–7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

AB  - The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a critical brain region for cocaine-memory reconsolidation. Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 (CRFR1) is densely expressed in the BLA, and CRFR1 stimulation can activate intra-cellular signaling cascades that mediate memory reconsolidation. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that BLA CRFR1 stimulation is necessary and sufficient for cocaine-memory reconsolidation. Using an instrumental model of drug relapse, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats received cocaine self-administration training in a distinct environmental context over 10 days followed by extinction training in a different context over 7 days. Next, rats were re-exposed to the cocaine-paired context for 15 min to initiate cocaine-memory retrieval and destabilization. Immediately or 6 h after this session, the rats received bilateral vehicle, antalarmin (CRFR1 antagonist; 500 ng/hemisphere), or corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF; 0.2, 30 or 500 ng/hemisphere) infusions into the BLA. Resulting changes in drug context-induced cocaine seeking (index of context-cocaine memory strength) were assessed three days later. Female rats self-administered more cocaine infusions and exhibited more extinction responding than males. Intra-BLA antalarmin treatment immediately after memory retrieval (i.e., when cocaine memories were labile), but not 6 h later (i.e., after memory reconsolidation), attenuated drug context-induced cocaine seeking at test independent of sex, relative to vehicle. Conversely, intra-BLA CRF treatment increased this behavior selectively in females, in a U-shaped dose-dependent fashion. In control experiments, a high (behaviorally ineffective) dose of CRF treatment did not reduce BLA CRFR1 cell-surface expression in females. Thus, BLA CRFR1 signaling is necessary and sufficient, in a sex-dependent manner, for regulating cocaine-memory strength. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cocaine use disorder is associated with alterations in immune function including altered expression of multiple peripheral cytokines in humans—several of which correlate with drug use. Individuals suffering from cocaine use disorder show altered immune system responses to drug-associated cues, highlighting the interaction between the brain and immune system as a critical factor in the development and expression of cocaine use disorder. We have previously demonstrated in animal models that cocaine use upregulates the expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)—a pleiotropic cytokine—in the serum and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). G-CSF signaling has been causally linked to behavioral responses to cocaine across multiple behavioral domains. The goal of this study was to define whether increases in G-CSF alter the pharmacodynamic effects of cocaine on the dopamine system and whether this occurs via direct mechanisms within local NAc microcircuits. We find that systemic G-CSF injection increases cocaine effects on dopamine terminals. The enhanced dopamine levels in the presence of cocaine occur through a release-based mechanism, rather than through effects on the dopamine transporter—as uptake rates were unchanged following G-CSF treatment. Critically, this effect could be recapitulated by acute bath application of G-CSF to dopamine terminals, an effect that was occluded by prior G-CSF treatment, suggesting a similar mechanistic basis for direct and systemic exposures. This work highlights the critical interaction between the immune system and psychostimulant effects that can alter drug responses and may play a role in vulnerability to cocaine use disorder.

AB  - Repeated cocaine exposure causes dendritic spine loss in the orbitofrontal cortex, which might contribute to poor orbitofrontal cortical function following drug exposure. One challenge, however, has been verifying links between neuronal structural plasticity and behavior, if any. Here we report that cocaine self-administration triggers the loss of dendritic spines on excitatory neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex of male and female mice (as has been reported in rats). To understand functional consequences, we locally ablated neuronal β1-integrins, cell adhesion receptors that adhere cells to the extracellular matrix and thus support dendritic spine stability. Degradation of β1-integrin tone: 1) caused dendritic spine loss; 2) exaggerated cocaine-seeking responses in a cue-induced reinstatement test; and 3) impaired the ability of mice to integrate new learning into familiar routines - a key function of the orbitofrontal cortex. Stimulating Abl-related gene (Arg) kinase, over-expressing Proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2), and inhibiting Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinase (ROCK) corrected response strategies, uncovering a β1-integrin-mediated signaling axis that controls orbitofrontal cortical function. Finally, use of a combinatorial gene silencing/chemogenetic strategy revealed that β1-integrins support the ability of mice to integrate new information into established behaviors by sustaining orbitofrontal cortical connections with the basolateral amygdala.

AB  - Background: Orexin-A (OrxA) administration in the posterior paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (pPVT) reinstates extinguished cocaine-seeking behaviour following extended access to the drug (a model of dependence). The pPVT receives and integrates information associated with emotionally salient events and sends excitatory inputs to brain regions involved in the expression of emotional states, such as those driving cocaine-seeking behaviour (i.e., the nucleus accumbens, the central nucleus of the amygdala [CeA], the basolateral amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis [BNST] and the prefrontal cortex). Methods: We monitored the activation pattern of these regions (measured by Fos) during cocaine-seeking induced by OrxA administered to the pPVT. The BNST and CeA emerged as being selectively activated. To test whether the functionality of these regions was pivotal during OrxA-induced cocaine-seeking behaviour, we transiently inactivated these regions concomitantly with OrxA administration to the pPVT. We then tested the participation of corticotropin-releasing factor receptors (CRF₁) in the CeA during OrxA-induced cocaine-seeking using the CRF₁ antagonist CP154526. Results: We observed selective activation of the CeA and BNST during cocaine-seeking induced by OrxA administered to the pPVT, but only transient inactivation of the CeA prevented cocaine-seeking behaviour. Administration of CP154526 to the CeA prevented OrxA-induced cocaine-seeking behaviour. Limitations: The use of only male rats could have been a limitation. Other limitations could have been the use of an indirect approach to test the hypothesis that administration of OrxA to the pPVT drives cocaine-seeking via CRF₁ signalling in the CeA, and a lack of analysis of the participation of CeA subregions. Conclusion: Cocaine-seeking behaviour induced by OrxA administered to the pPVT is driven by activation of the CeA via CRF₁ signalling. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Several meta-analyses of observational studies have addressed the association between risk and protective factors and cannabis/cocaine/opioid use disorders, but results are conflicting. No umbrella review has ever graded the credibility of this evidence (not significant/weak/suggestive/highly suggestive/convincing). We searched Pubmed-MEDLINE/PsycInfo, last search September 21, 2020. We assessed the quality of meta-analyses with the AMSTAR-2 tool. Out of 3,072 initial references, five were included, providing 19 associations between 12 putative risk/protective factors and cannabis/cocaine/opioid use disorders (cases: 4539; N = 1,118,872,721). While 84 % of the associations were statistically significant, none was convincing. One risk factor (smoking) had highly suggestive evidence for association with nonmedical use of prescription opioid medicines (OR = 3.07, 95 %CI:2.27 to 4.14). Convincing evidence emerged in sensitivity analyses on antisocial behavior and cannabis use disoder (OR 3.34, 95 %CI 2.53–4.41). Remaining associations had weak evidence. The quality of meta-analyses was rated as moderate in two (40 %), low in one (20 %), and critically low in two (40 %). Future research is needed to better profile risk/protective factors for cannabis/cocaine/opioid use disorders disorders informing preventive approaches.

AB  - Purpose: Patterns of psychostimulant (PST) use, psychological and physical factors, and family relationships were investigated in a nationally representative sample of adolescents. The differences between users of cocaine (Cc), ecstasy/MDMA, and amphetamine (EA) were analyzed, taking into account gender differences. Methods: Substance use, psychological factors (lifetime suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts in the previous year, visits to a mental health professional), physical factors (health and body shape perceptions (BSP), body mass index (BMI)), and family relationships (existence of disagreements with parents, relationships with mother and father) were investigated in 26,351 17-year-old French adolescents. Results: Lifetime suicidal behavior was strongly associated with EA use only. Suicidal ideation in the previous year was associated with Cc use among both boys and girls and associated with EA use among girls. Compared to Cc users, more EA users were overweight, while more Cc users were underweight compared to EA users. BSP, BMI, and EA use were related in girls only. Having a good or very good relationship with both mother and father was negatively associated with Cc use in boys and girls. Girls who had a good or very good relationship with their fathers seemed to be less prone to use EA. Boys with a good or very good relationship with their mothers seemed to be less prone to use EA. Conclusion: The results of the present study could serve as a basis for prevention and harm reduction strategies/programs targeting youth use and for the adaptation of these strategies/programs according to substance and gender.

AB  - Repeated cocaine use induces coordinated changes in gene expression that drive plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), an important component of the brain’s reward circuitry, and promote the development of maladaptive, addiction-like behaviors. Studies on the molecular basis of cocaine action identify transcription factors, a class of proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate transcription, as critical mediators of this cocaine-induced plasticity. Early methods to identify and study transcription factors involved in addiction pathophysiology primarily relied on quantifying the expression of candidate genes in bulk brain tissue after chronic cocaine treatment, as well as conventional overexpression and knockdown techniques. More recently, advances in next generation sequencing, bioinformatics, cell-type-specific targeting, and locus-specific neuroepigenomic editing offer a more powerful, unbiased toolbox to identify the most important transcription factors that drive drug-induced plasticity and to causally define their downstream molecular mechanisms. Here, we synthesize the literature on transcription factors mediating cocaine action in the NAc, discuss the advancements and remaining limitations of current experimental approaches, and emphasize recent work leveraging bioinformatic tools and neuroepigenomic editing to study transcription factors involved in cocaine addiction.

AB  - Assessed whether treatment with ketamine alters plasma levels of BDNF and VEGF and whether BDNF and VEGF levels correlate in individuals with major depressive disorder. Data for the current analysis were drawn from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 39 MDD participants that investigated neurobiological correlates associated with ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects; results have previously been published. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two drug orders (ketamine-placebo or placebo-ketamine). BDNF and VEGF plasma levels were measured in duplicate with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays used according to manufacturer recommendations. Treatment did not affect either BDNF or VEGF levels in the total group. In addition, drug-by-time interactions found no differential drug effects at different time points for BDNF or VGEF.

AB  - Ketamine (KET), an anesthetic, analgesic, and a sedative N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist agent, exposure during neonatal period may lead to learning impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive decline in the later years of life. In recent studies, it has been reported that sedative-acting α2 agonist dexmedetomidine (DEX), which is commonly used in clinical practice with KET, has neuroprotective effects and prevents the undesirable effects of anesthesia. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these actions, we investigated the interaction between NMDA receptors α₂ adrenoceptor and adulthood behaviors in neonatally KET and/or DEX administrated mice. Balb/c male mice were administrated with saline, KET (75 mg/kg), DEX (10 µg/kg), or KET + DEX (75 mg/kg + 10 µg/kg) on postnatal day 7. During adulthood (8–10 weeks old) mice were subjected to elevated plus maze, open field, and Morris water maze tests. After behavioral tests, hippocampus samples were extracted for mRNA expression studies of NMDAR subunits (GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B) and α₂ adrenoceptor subunits (α2A, α2B, and α2C) by real-time PCR. Ketamine increased horizontal and vertical locomotor activity (p < 0.01) and impaired spatial learning-memory (p < 0.05). DEX increased anxiety-like behavior (p < 0.01), but did not affect spatial learning-memory and locomotor activity. KET + DEX impaired spatial learning-memory (p < 0.01), increased horizontal locomotor activity (p < 0.01), and anxiety-like behavior (p < 0.05). Our study implies that DEX cannot prevent the adverse effects of KET, on spatial learning-memory, and locomotor activity. In addition to this, it can be thought that during brain development, there is an interaction between NMDAR and α₂ adrenoceptor systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Psychostimulant use disorder is a major public health issue, and despite the scope of the problem there are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments. There would be tremendous utility in development of a treatment that could help patients both achieve and maintain abstinence. Previous work from our group has identified granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) as a neuroactive cytokine that alters behavioral response to cocaine, increases synaptic dopamine release, and enhances cognitive flexibility. Here, we investigate the role of G-CSF in affecting extinction and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking and perform detailed characterization of its proteomic effects in multiple limbic substructures. Male Sprague Dawley rats were injected with PBS or G-CSF during (1) extinction or (2) abstinence from cocaine self-administration, and drug seeking behavior was measured. Quantitative assessment of changes in the proteomic landscape in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were performed via data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry analysis. Administration of G-CSF during extinction accelerated the rate of extinction, and administration during abstinence attenuated cue-induced cocaine-seeking. Analysis of global protein expression demonstrated that G-CSF regulated proteins primarily in mPFC that are critical to glutamate signaling and synapse maintenance. Taken together, these findings support G-CSF as a viable translational research target with the potential to reduce drug craving or seeking behaviors. Importantly, recombinant G-CSF exists as an FDA-approved medication which may facilitate rapid clinical translation. Additionally, using cutting-edge multiregion discovery proteomics analyses, these studies identify a novel mechanism underlying G-CSF effects on behavioral plasticity.

AB  - We report here the involvement of the stress-responsive glucocorticoid receptor co-chaperone FKBP51 in the mechanism of in vivo secretion of mature BDNF (mBDNF). We used a novel method combining brain microdialysis with a capillary electrophoresis-based immunoassay, to examine mBDNF secretion in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in vivo in freely moving mice. By combining optogenetic, neurochemical (KCl-evoked depolarization), and transgenic (conditional BDNF knockout mice) means, we have shown that the increase in extracellular mBDNF in vivo is determined by neuronal activity. Withal, mBDNF secretion in the mPFC of mice was stimulated by a systemic administration of S-ketamine (10 or 50 mg/kg) or S-hydroxynorketamine (10 mg/kg). KCl- and S-ketamine-evoked mBDNF secretion was strongly dependent on the expression of FKBP51. Moreover, the inability of S-ketamine to evoke a transient secretion in mBDNF in the mPFC in FKBP51- knockout mice matched the lack of antidepressant-like effect of S-ketamine in the tail suspension test. Our data reveal a critical role of FKBP51 in mBDNF secretion and suggest the involvement of mBDNF in the realization of immediate stress-coping behavior induced by acute S-ketamine.

AB  - Objectives: Synaptic plasticity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling are proposed to play key roles in antidepressant drug action. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and putative antidepressant, may increase synaptic plasticity in prefrontal cortex through higher expression of BDNF. Furthermore, ketamine was shown to change resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Methods: In a randomised, placebo-controlled study, we investigated acutely (100 min) and at 24 h following subanesthetic ketamine infusion which dmPFC seeded RSFC changes are most strongly associated with plasma BDNF level changes in 53 healthy participants (21 females, age: 24.4 ± 2.9 years) using 7 T-fMRI. Results: We observed higher relative levels of BDNF 2 h and 24 h after ketamine compared to placebo. Whole-brain regression revealed that the change in BDNF after 24 h was associated with RSFC decreases from dmPFC to posterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial PFC at 24 h and exploratively also at the 100 min measurement point. Follow-up analyses revealed that RSFC reductions following ketamine were restricted to subjects showing increased BDNF levels at 24 h. Conclusions: Our findings indicate BDNF level dynamics following ketamine are related to acute and 24 h RSFC changes. Particularly when BDNF increases are observed after ketamine infusion, a disconnection from dmPFC after 24 h is seen and may reflect synaptic plasticity effects.

AB  - Introduction: Ketamine exhibits antidepressant properties in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) with some concern over its cardiovascular safety and tolerability issues. This paper reports on the cardiovascular safety in short-term intravenous ketamine treatment in TRD inpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BP). Materials and Methods: The observational study population comprises 35 MDD and 14 BP subjects treated with intravenous ketamine. Results: Blood pressure (RR) and heart rate (HR) values returned to baseline within 1.5-hours post infusion with no sequelae for all study subjects. Six time points were analyzed for each infusion: 0’, 15’, 30’, 45’, 60’ and 90’ for RR and HR. After the infusion significant peaks in systolic (p = 0.004) and diastolic (p = 0.038) RR were seen. In concomitant medication with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), higher RR peaks (p = 0.020; p = 0.048) were seen as compared to other subjects. The decrease in HR was greater (p = 0.02) in the absence of concomitant medication with mood stabilizers as compared to subjects receiving mood stabilizing medication accompanied by the observation of a greater decrease in diastolic RR among those taking mood stabilizers (p = 0.009). Limitations: The study may be underpowered due to the small sample size. The observations apply to an inhomogeneous TRD population in a single-site, pilot study, with no blinding and are limited to the acute administration. Conclusion: The study demonstrates good safety and tolerability profile of intravenous ketamine as add-on intervention to current psychotropic medication in TRD, regardless of the MDD or BP type of mood disorders. The abatement of elevated RR and BP scores was observed in time with no sequelae nor harm. Still, cardiovascular risks appear to be more pronounced in subjects with comorbid arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Rhabdomyolysis is associated with methamphetamine, amphetamine, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MA) use. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency, severity, and risk factors of rhabdomyolysis associated with MA use. Methods: We reviewed patients with an MA-positive toxicology screen with and without diagnosed rhabdomyolysis based on initial creatine kinase (CK) concentration over a period of 6 years. Demographics, vital signs, disposition, diagnoses, and laboratory results were recorded. Results: There were 7,319 patients with an MA-positive toxicology screen, of whom 957 (13%) were screened for rhabdomyolysis and included in the study. The majority were male, White, and middle-aged and smoked tobacco. Psychiatric (34%), neurological (15%), and trauma (13%) were the most common discharge diagnostic groups. The majority (55%) were admitted, and 8% were discharged to an inpatient psychiatric facility. Concomitant substance use included ethanol (10%) and cocaine (8%), and 190 (20%) had rhabdomyolysis with median (interquartile range) CK of 2,610 (1,530–6,212) U/L and range 1,020 to 98,172 U/L. There was significant difference in renal function between the rhabdomyolysis and non-rhabdomyolysis patients. Other differences included gender and troponin I concentration. A higher proportion of patients screening positive for both MA and cocaine use experienced rhabdomyolysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed elevated troponin I, blood urea nitrogen, and/or creatinine concentration and male gender to be significant factors associated with rhabdomyolysis. Conclusions: The frequency of rhabdomyolysis in patients screening positive for MA was 20%. Factors associated with rhabdomyolysis in MA-positive patients included elevated troponin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine concentration, and male gender. Clinicians caring for patients who screen positive for MA should also consider concomitant rhabdomyolysis, especially if renal/cardiac laboratory tests are abnormal and even if there is no history of injury, agitation, or physical restraint.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Anecdotal evidence suggests a substantial proportion of individuals with cocaine use disorder do not report craving during inpatient detoxification. Objective To examine prevalence and clinical correlates of consistent absence of cocaine craving among inpatients during detoxification. We hypothesized that craving absence would be associated with less severity of cocaine use, depression, and anxiety. Alternative explanations were also explored. Methods Craving absence (i.e., non-cravers) was defined as a daily score of zero across two separate craving visual analogue scales in each of the inpatient days. Participants scoring ≥1 on ≥1 day were considered cravers. Severity of cocaine use disorder as well as in-treatment depression and anxiety were assessed. Alternative contributors included presence of cocaine and other substances in urine at admission, in-treatment prescription of psychotropic medications, treatment motivation, executive function, interoception, and social desirability. Results Eighty-seven participants (78.2% males) met criteria as either non-cravers (n = 29; 33.3%) or cravers (n = 58; 66.7%). Mean length of admission in non-cravers and cravers was, respectively, 10.83 and 13.16 days. Binary logistic regression model showed that non-cravers scored significantly lower than cravers on cocaine use during last month before treatment (OR, 95% CI; 0.902, 0.839–0.970), in-treatment depression (OR, 95% CI; 0.794, 0.659–0.956), and in-treatment prescribing of antipsychotics (OR, 95% CI; 0.109, 0.014–0.823). Model prediction accuracy was 88.9%. Conclusions One in three patients undergoing inpatient detoxification experienced absence of craving, linked to less pretreatment cocaine use, better mood, and decreased administration of antipsychotics. Findings may inform pretreatment strategies and improve treatment cost-effectiveness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Ketamine is a rapid-acting antidepressant but its mechanism remains unclear. Vascular endothelial growth factor growth factor (VEGF) has been reported in the antidepressant action of ketamine in rodents. VEGF and pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF) signalling are closely linked and both are dysregulated in depression. We explored the effect of a single infusion of ketamine, with midazolam as comparison, on peripheral whole blood mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and PEDF, and the VEGFA/PEDF ratio, in patients with depression. Methods: Twenty-five patients with depression were randomised to either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) infusions over 40 min. Blood plasma samples were taken 1 h before the first infusion and 4 h after the infusion start. mRNA was extracted and qRT-PCR performed to analyse gene expression. Results: Single infusions of ketamine and midazolam both decreased depression scores (F(1,21) = 102.40, p < 0.000). There was a significant group × time interaction for VEGFA mRNA levels (F(1, 21) = 5.207, p = 0.029), with ketamine increasing VEGFA levels. There was no significant effect of either ketamine or midazolam on PEDF levels. There was a significant group × time interaction for VEGFA/PEDF mRNA ratio, with ketamine alone increasing this ratio (F(1, 11) = 12.085, p = 0.005). Limitations: Patients were on psychotropic medication and continued treatment as usual throughout the study. Conclusions: These preliminary results support a role for VEGF in the action of ketamine and suggest a novel role for VEGF/PEDF in the molecular response to ketamine.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with concurrent illicit drug use of opiates and crack/cocaine use among individuals receiving of opioid medication-assisted treatment (MAT) in one English rural/urban County Council area. Methods: 776 opiate users in treatment were assessed using the Addiction Dimensions for Assessment and Personalised Treatment (ADAPT) assessment tool. The tool encompasses three domains and 14 subdomains covering addiction severity, recovery strengths and coexisting health and social needs. Data were opportunistically matched to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS) and the Treatment Outcome Profile (TOP). Two backward stepwise logistic regression models were run to discern the nature of concurrent illicit drug use. Results: Addiction severity (Odds Ratio [OR] 12.55, Confidence interval [CI] 6.49–24.27), low recovery strengths (OR 2.30, CI 1.30–4.07) and no ‘urge/control’ (OR 27.45, 13.18–57.16) were strongly associated with concurrent use. Individuals with moderate psychological needs were more likely to be abstinent (OR 2.97, CI 1.67–5.29) compared to those with no need. Abstaining from injecting (OR 2.38, CI 1.15–4.93), alcohol consumption (OR 1.55, CI 1.05–2.30), increasing age (OR 1.03, CI 1.01-1.06) and increased quality-of-life (OR 1.05, CI 1.00–1.10) were associated with abstinence from concurrent use. Conclusion: Practitioner assessments with self-report data offer unique perspectives on service users’ holistic needs. Interventions addressing concurrent use during MAT should consider managing urges and control of illicit Class A use, injecting and alcohol consumption within a stepped-care approach. Packages for developing recovery strengths supporting psychological need and enhancing quality-of-life is recommended. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cocaine addiction is characterized by alterations in motivational and cognitive processes involved in goal‐directed behavior. Recent studies have shown that addictive behaviors can be attributed to alterations in the activity of large functional networks. The aim of this study was to investigate how cocaine addiction affected the left frontoparietal network during goal‐directed behavior in a stop‐signal task (SST) with reward contingencies by correct task performance. Twenty‐eight healthy controls (HC) and 30 abstinent cocaine‐dependent patients (ACD) performed SST with monetary reward contingencies while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. The results showed that the left frontoparietal network (FPN) displayed an effect of cocaine addiction depending on reward contingencies rather than inhibition accuracy; and, second, we observed a negative correlation between dependence severity and the modulation of the left FPN network by the monetary reward in ACD. These findings highlight the role of the left FPN in the motivational effects of cocaine dependence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rationale: Illicit use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) may cause a mild or severe form of the serotonin syndrome. The syndrome intensity is not just influenced by drug doses but also by environmental factors.Objectives: Warm environmental temperatures and physical activity are features of raves. The purpose of this study was to assess how these two factors can potentially intensify the syndrome.Methods: Rats were administered MDMA at doses of 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg and examined in the absence or presence of warm temperature and physical activity. The syndrome intensity was estimated by visual scoring for behavioral syndrome and also instrumentally measuring changes in symptoms of the syndrome.Results: Our results showed that MDMA at 3 mg/kg, but not 0.3 or 1 mg/kg, caused a mild serotonin syndrome in rats. Each environmental factor alone moderately intensified the syndrome. When the two factors were combined, the intensification became more severe than each factor alone highlighting a synergistic effect. This intensification was blocked by the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907, competitive N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist CGS19755, autonomic ganglionic blocker hexamethonium, and the benzodiazepine-GABAA receptor agonist midazolam but not by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 or nicotinic receptor antagonist methyllycaconitine.Conclusions: Our data suggest that, in the absence of environmental factors, the MDMA-induced syndrome is mainly mediated through the serotonergic transmission (5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)-dependent mechanism) and therefore is relatively mild. Warm temperature and physical activity facilitate serotonergic and other neural systems such as glutamatergic and autonomic transmissions, resulting in intensification of the syndrome (non-5HT mechanisms).

AB  - Background: We present three women with gamm a- Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) dependence who lose control over their GHB consumption during the premenstrual period. During the late luteal phase, they relapsed into GHB use, but returned to abstinence at the beginning of the menstrual cycle.Methods: During inpatient detox they did not relapsed to GHB but they had high craving during each cycle We have measured these in two cycles. The severity of premenstrual complaints appears to be associated with GHB craving.Results: These cases illustrate that substance use may be related to the symptoms of premenstrual disorders.Conclusion: Therefore, addiction medicine specialists, family physicians and gynecologists should be aware of this possible relationship. Unfortunately, at present there are no guidelines for the treatment of this co-occurring disorder, however we provide some suggestions regarding how to reduce the risk of relapse in the late luteal phase.

AB  - Clinical and preclinical researches have shown that sub-anesthetic ketamine elicits sustained antidepressant effects for up to 1–2 weeks. Pharmacokinetics studies (t1/2 = 23 min) in mice showed no ketamine residue at 24 h after sub-anesthetic or anesthetic ketamine administration. Therefore, this study aims to reveal the mechanism underlying these different biological functions at 24 h after sub-anesthetic and anesthetic ketamine treatment. First, at the animal behavioral level, we found that sub-anesthetic ketamine induced antidepressant and anxiolytic effects while anesthetic ketamine induced depressive-like phenotypes and cognitive impairment. Second, we examined the correlation between behavior phenotype and protein expression, and found that the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level is oppositely regulated by sub-anesthetic and anesthetic ketamine. Sub-anesthetic ketamine significantly increased the BDNF level, correlating to antidepressant effects; whereas anesthetic dose reduced BDNF expression in the hippocampus, correlating to depressive-like behaviors, anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment. Third, the antidepressant effects of sub-anesthetic ketamine were prevented by pre-treatment of ANA-12, a Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) inhibitor. Thus, we conclude that BDNF may be the key factor underlying antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of sub-anesthetic ketamine at 24 h after treatment. These results may shed light on future studies and the development of long-lasting anti-depressant drugs and therapies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rationale: Current evidence and literature reviews provide a strong justification for examining the orexin receptor (OXR) system as a therapeutic target in substance use disorders, including cocaine and other psychostimulants. Objectives: In this preliminary, proof-of-concept examination of orexin modulation in humans with cocaine use disorder, we measured changes in domains tied to relapse: stress, sleep, cue reactivity, and inhibitory control. Additionally, mood symptoms (anxiety, depression), medication compliance, and side effects were assessed. Methods: Twenty non-treatment seeking subjects with cocaine use disorder (CUD) received either the OX₁R / OX₂R antagonist suvorexant PO or placebo at 10 PM daily for two weeks (10 mg week 1, 20 mg week 2). Using psychometrics, smart-watch actigraphy, a cold-pressor stress challenge, and eye-tracking technology, the following domains were examined: sleep, stress/anxiety, cue-reactivity (attentional bias, craving), and inhibitory control. Psychometric data were collected every M/W/F (7 time points). Laboratory data were collected weekly (3 time points). Results: Bayesian and frequentist generalized linear models were employed in parallel to examine the effects of suvorexant compared to placebo, with a Bayesian posterior probability threshold > 80% as evidence of a signal for suvorexant. Notable results favoring suvorexant over placebo included fewer total anti-saccade errors, improved sleep actigraphy (sleep/awake periods), pre/post cold-pressor change in heart rate and salivary cortisol (all posterior probabilities >94%), and craving (posterior probability > 87%). Conclusions: Initial but restricted evidence is provided supporting the orexin system as a modulator of relapse-related processes in cocaine use disorder. Baseline differences in the main outcome variables were not experimentally controlled and differences in craving were observed at baseline. This, in combination with a limited sample size, constrain the nature of the project. The results may serve to inform more comprehensive future research.

AB  - Objective Studies have linked cocaine dependence to suicidality. According to the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, suicidal behavior becomes likely with the simultaneous presence of perceived burdensomeness (PB), lack of (or thwarted) belongingness (TB), and acquired fearlessness about death (FAD). Here, we examined personality and other variables, including depression, self‐esteem, childhood abuse, and substance use, as predictors of these risk factors in cocaine‐dependent individuals (CDs). Methods Seventy CDs and 70 healthy controls (HCs) participated. We examined group differences in a group‐by‐sex analysis of variance and identified predictors of PB, TB, and FAD in stepwise regressions. Results CDs exhibited elevated PB and TB but not FAD, compared to HCs. CDs also exhibited elevated harm avoidance, novelty seeking, depression, and lower self‐esteem and reward dependence. Females reported elevated sexual abuse, harm avoidance, reward dependence, depression, but lower FAD, relative to males, among CDs and HCs. Among CDs, PB was predicted by lower self‐esteem and greater emotional abuse; TB was predicted by lower self‐esteem and reward dependence, as well as greater emotional and sexual abuse; and FAD was predicted by lower harm avoidance and greater physical abuse. Conclusions Interventions targeting suicidality in cocaine dependence should take into consideration self‐esteem, personality traits, and childhood abuse.

AB  - Background: Anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity may cause permanent dysfunctions in human brains. In this work, we used a cell-based in-vitro model to demonstrate that traditional Chinese medicine, Kami-Shoyo-San may protect ketamine-induced neuronal apoptosis in human embryonic stem cell-differentiated neurons. Methods: Human embryonic stem cell-differentiated neurons were cultured in vitro and treated with high-concentration ketamine to induce neuronal apoptosis. Pre-incubation of Kami-Shoyo-San was conducted to evaluate its neuroprotection on ketamine-injured neurons. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot assays were used to assess brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B, in response to Kami-Shoyo-San and ketamine treatment. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling pathway was then deactivated, by siRNA application, to further explore its functional role in Kami-Shoyo-San-mediated protection on ketamine-induced apoptosis among human embryonic stem cell-differentiated neurons. Results: High concentration of ketamine-induced significant apoptosis, whereas pre-incubation of Kami-Shoyo-San markedly rescued ketamine-induced apoptosis, in human embryonic stem cell-differentiated neurons. Kami-Shoyo-San activated brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling pathway by upregulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor and inducing tropomyosin receptor kinase B phosphorylation. Conversely, siRNA-mediated brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling pathway deactivation reversed the neuroprotection of Kami-Shoyo-San in ketamine-injured human embryonic stem cell-differentiated neurons. Conclusion: Kami-Shoyo-San could protect ketamine-induced neurotoxicity, and the underlying mechanism may involve brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling pathway.

AB  - This paper explores the recent resurgence in use of ecstasy/MDMA in Europe and highlights keys areas of continuity and divergence between the ecstasy market of the 1990s and the current MDMA market. Based on a scoping study involving a targeted multi-source data collection exercise on MDMA, it highlights nine areas that have undergone some level of change, linked with both supply and demand for the drug. Factors discussed include: innovation in production techniques; changes in precursor chemical availability; the role of online markets; competition with other stimulants and new psychoactive substances; the increased availability of high-strength MDMA; and the shift from subcultural towards more mainstream use of the drug. The paper proposes that the MDMA on Europe’s contemporary market is in some respects a third generation product with a different consumer profile, with implications that responses developed at the time of the drug’s earlier iteration, may be in need of a review and revamp.

AB  - While a disproportionately large percentage of sexual minorities engage in illicit drug use, little research has specifically examined factors related to cocaine use among bisexual men and women. The present study sought to identify the potential association between affective/emotive states and previous substance use and lifetime cocaine use among a national sample of bisexual men and women. A secondary analysis of the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health was conducted among 1,989 adults aged older than 18 years in the United States who identified as bisexual. One in five (20.5%) reported lifetime cocaine use. Significant factors included age, previous use of illicit substances, and feeling low/tired nearly every day. Feeling worthless was associated with a lower likelihood of lifetime cocaine use. Recommendations (e.g., focus groups, behavioral maintenance programs) for health professionals aimed at reducing substance abuse rates among sexual minority individuals are highlighted.

AB  - Brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates a variety of physiological processes, and several studies have explored the role of BDNF in addiction‐related brain regions like the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). We sought to understand the rapid effects of endogenous BDNF on cocaine seeking. Rats were trained to self‐administer cocaine and extinguished. We then microinjected two inhibitors of BDNF stimulation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), the non‐competitive receptor antagonist ANA‐12 and TrkB/Fc, a fusion protein that binds BDNF and prevents TrkB stimulation. Blocking TrkB or inactivating BDNF in NAcore potentiated active lever pressing, showing that endogenous BDNF tone was present and supplying inhibitory tone on cue‐induced reinstatement. To determine if exogenous BDNF also negatively regulated reinstatement, BDNF was microinjected into NAcore 15 minutes before cue‐induced reinstatement. BDNF decreased cocaine seeking through TrkB receptor binding, but had no effect on inactive lever pressing, spontaneous or cocaine‐induced locomotion, or on reinstated sucrose seeking. BDNF‐infusion potentiated within trial extinction when microinjected in the NAcore during cue‐ and context + cue induced reinstatement, and the inhibition of lever pressing lasted at least 3 days post injection. Although decreased reinstatement endured for 3 days when BDNF was administered prior to a reinstatement session, when microinjected before an extinction session or in the home cage, BDNF did not alter subsequent cued‐reinstatement. Together, these data show that endogenous BDNF acts on TrKB to provide inhibitory tone on reinstated cocaine seeking, and this effect was recapitulated by exogenous BDNF.

AB  - It is well-documented in the literature that individuals repeatedly exposed to cocaine exhibit cognitive impairment and that cognitive dysfunction is a risk factor for poor treatment outcomes in those with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Specific deficits related to attention, episodic memory, working memory, and executive functioning are the most common deficits noted in this population. Given that cognitive impairment is a risk factor for poor treatment outcomes in those with CUD, identifying possible moderating factors contributing to and/or exacerbating cocaine-related cognitive deficits is of great importance. Some of these factors may include premorbid intellectual functioning, cocaine use patterns, polysubstance use, comorbid emotional symptoms, and sleep dysfunction. It is plausible that by identifying moderating factors impacting cognition, behavioral interventions can then be modified accordingly and/or treatment regimens can be augmented with pharmacological interventions (e.g., cognitive enhancing agents), leading to a reduction in treatment attrition and improved treatment outcomes. The currently available treatments for CUD are mainly behavioral with variable efficacy, and even though there have been great preclinical and clinical research efforts focused on medication development for CUD, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for CUD. A description of some of the several potential moderating factors, along with some pharmacological treatments which have been shown to ameliorate, at least to some extent, cognitive dysfunction in those with CUD are discussed.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Platelet-derived growth factor B chain is a novel target gene of cocaine-mediated Notch1 signaling: Implications for HIV-associated neurological disorders' by Honghong Yao, Ming Duan, Guoku Hu and Shilpa Buch (The Journal of Neuroscience, 2011[Aug][31], Vol 31[35], 12449-12454). In the original article, on page 12452, within Figure 4D, an erroneous image of the Western blot for β-actin in the left and right panels was included. This error does not affect the conclusions of the article. The updated Figure 4 is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-23175-003[/rid]). Neuroinflammation associated with HIV-1 infection is exacerbated in cocaine-abusing, HIV+ individuals. The underlying mechanisms are, in part, attributable to disruption of the blood– brain barrier modulated by cocaine via platelet-derived growth factor B chain (PDGF-B). Since Notch signaling plays a critical role in CNS homeostasis, we hypothesized that it may have a role in cocaine-mediated induction of PDGF-B. The goal of this study was to link Notch signaling with PDGF-B. Using Western blot analysis, we demonstrate the role of Notch1 signaling in cocaine-mediated induction of PDGF-B in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Exposure of cells to the γ-secretase inhibitor-DAPT or silencing of Notch1 resulted in abrogation of cocaine-mediated induction of PDGF-B. Reciprocally, activation of the Notch1 receptor by exposing cells to the Notch ligand Jagged-1 resulted in upregulation of PDGF-B expression. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that cocaine-mediated activation of Notch1 signaling leading to targeted expression of PDGF-B involved activation of the downstream effector CSL. Functional implication of Notch1 signaling in regulating expression of the vascular permeant PDGF-B was confirmed in vitro using cell permeability assays. In vivo relevance was further corroborated in cocaine-treated mice that demonstrated increased permeability of the endothelial barrier as evidenced by Evans blue and sodium fluorescein extravasation. Specificity of Notch1 signaling in vivo was validated in mice exposed to DAPT, which failed to demonstrate barrier disruption following cocaine exposure. This is the first evidence of involvement of Notch1 activation in cocaine-mediated regulation of PDGF-B expression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, which on administration produces fast-acting antidepressant responses in patients with major depressive disorder. Yet, the mechanism underlying the antidepressant action of ketamine remains unclear. Methods: To unravel the mechanism of action of ketamine, we treated wild-type C57BL/6 mice with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) specific inhibitor tatCN21 peptide. We also used eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) (also known as CaMKIII) knockout mice. We analyzed the effects biochemically and behaviorally, using the forced swim, tail suspension, and novelty suppressed feeding tests. Results: Consistent with the literature, one of the major pathways mediating the antidepressant action of ketamine was reduction of phosphorylation of eEF2 via eEF2K. Specifically, knocking out eEF2K in mice eliminated phosphorylation of eEF2 at threonine at position 56, resulting in increased protein synthesis, and made mice resistant both biochemically and behaviorally to the antidepressant effects of ketamine. In addition, administration of ketamine led to differential regulation of CaMKII function, manifested as autoinhibition (pT305 phosphorylation) followed by autoactivation (pT286) of CaMKIIα in the hippocampus and cortex. The inhibition phase of CaMKII, which lasted 10 to 20 minutes after administration of ketamine, occurred concurrently with eEF2K-dependent increased protein synthesis. Moreover, ketamine administration–dependent delayed induction of GluA1 (24 hours) was regulated by the activation of CaMKII. Importantly, systemic administration of the CaMKII inhibitor tatCN21 increased global protein synthesis and induced behavioral resistance to ketamine. Conclusions: Our data suggest that drugs that selectively target CaMKs and regulate protein synthesis offer novel strategies for treatment of major depressive disorder.

AB  - Youth involved in child welfare services (CWS) are at elevated risk for substance use. CWS involvement may provide an opportunity for intervention to prevent subsequent use; however, little is known about mitigating substance use risk in this population. Using data from the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II), the present study examined individual, psychological, and contextual risk factors (e.g., prior substance use, depression, posttraumatic stress, maltreatment experiences) and protective factors (e.g., caregiver monitoring, peer relationships) following CWS involvement (Wave 1) in relation to alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine use 36 months later (Wave 3). The nationally-representative sample of CWS-involved youth was restricted to individuals who were aged 11 years or older at Wave 1 and had at least a partial interview at Wave 3 (N = 763). Three logistic regression models showed that Wave 1 substance use increased the likelihood of marijuana and cocaine use at Wave 3 [marijuana OR = 1.41 (1.19–1.68); cocaine OR = 1.26 (1.07–1.50)] but not binge alcohol use [OR = 1.44 (0.95–2.19)]. Other risk and protective factors had limited predictive value for Wave 3 substance use. The present findings suggest that initiating substance use prior to or at the time of CWS involvement is a critical risk factor for later substance use. Substance use screening and referral to treatment is imperative for CWS-involved youth. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Growth factors play an important role in brain development. Whether epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays a role in the pathophysiology of ketamine related disorders is unexplored. In this study, we examined the serum levels of EGF in chronic ketamine users as compared with healthy controls. The possible correlation between serum EGF levels with the demographic, ketamine use characteristics and psychopathological symptoms were analyzed. Methods: Sixty‐seven chronic ketamine users and 40 healthy subjects were recruited. Serum EGF levels were measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory. Results: The serum level of EGF in the chronic ketamine users was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects (22.34 ± 4.81 pg/ml vs. 87.10 ± 2.96 pg/ml, F = 15.169, p < 0.01). The serum EGF level was negatively correlated with the current average dose of ketamine consumption per day of use (p = 0.015), and positively associated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive symptom score (p = .022). Conclusions: Serum level of EGF decreased in chronic ketamine users compared with healthy subjects, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of ketamine related disorders.

AB  - Background: Lasting changes in gene expression in brain reward regions, including nucleus accumbens (NAc), contribute to persistent functional changes in the addicted brain. We and others have demonstrated that altered expression of several candidate transcription factors in NAc regulates drug responses. A recent large-scale genome-wide study from our group predicted transcription factor E2F3 (E2F3) as a prominent upstream regulator of cocaine-induced changes in gene expression and alternative splicing. Methods: We studied expression of two E2F3 isoforms—E2F3a and E2F3b—in mouse NAc after repeated cocaine administration and assayed the effects of overexpression or depletion of E2f3 isoforms in NAc on cocaine behavioral responses. We then performed RNA sequencing to investigate the effect of E2f3a overexpression in this region on gene expression and alternative splicing and performed quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation at downstream targets in NAc following E2f3a overexpression or repeated cocaine exposure. Sample sizes varied between experiments and are noted in the text. Results: We showed that E2f3a, but not E2f3b, overexpression or knockdown in mouse NAc regulates cocaine-induced locomotor and place conditioning behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrated that E2f3a overexpression substantially recapitulates genome-wide transcriptional profiles and alternative splicing induced by cocaine. We further validated direct binding of E2F3a at key target genes following cocaine exposure. Conclusions: This study establishes E2F3a as a novel transcriptional regulator of cocaine action in NAc. The findings reveal a crucial role for E2F3a in the regulation of cocaine-elicited behavioral states. Moreover, the importance of this role is bolstered by the extensive recapitulation of cocaine’s transcriptional effects in NAc by overexpression of E2f3a.

AB  - The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a primary brain reward region composed predominantly of medium spiny neurons (MSNs). In response to early withdrawal from repeated cocaine administration, de novo dendritic spine formation occurs in NAc MSNs. Much evidence indicates that this new spine formation facilitates the rewarding properties of cocaine. Early withdrawal from repeated cocaine also produces dramatic alterations in the transcriptome of NAc MSNs, but how such alterations influence cocaine’s effects on dendritic spine formation remain unclear. Studies in non-neuronal cells indicate that actin cytoskeletal regulatory pathways in nuclei have a direct role in the regulation of gene transcription in part by controlling the access of co-activators to their transcription factor partners. In particular, actin state dictates the interaction between the serum response factor (SRF) transcription factor and one of its principal co-activators, MAL. Here we show that cocaine induces alterations in nuclear F-actin signaling pathways in the NAc with associated changes in the nuclear subcellular localization of SRF and MAL. Using in vivo optogenetics, the brain region-specific inputs to the NAc that mediate these nuclear changes are investigated. Finally, we demonstrate that regulated SRF expression, in turn, is critical for the effects of cocaine on dendritic spine formation and for cocaine-mediated behavioral sensitization. Collectively, these findings reveal a mechanism by which nuclear-based changes influence the structure of NAc MSNs in response to cocaine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Poor working memory is linked to future risk‐taking behaviors. Lifelong risk of habitual drug use is highest in individuals who initiate use in early adolescence. We sought to determine in rats whether juvenile traits, specifically poor working memory and low salivary brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are related to elevated cocaine taking and relapse in adolescence and adulthood. On postnatal day (P) 20, working memory was assessed using the novel object recognition task in male and female rats. Saliva was assayed at P20 for BDNF before cocaine self‐administration on P28 [0.75 or 0.25 mg/kg/infusion for 30 days under a fixed‐ratio (FR) 1 to FR5 schedule] and on P94 before relapse after 30‐day abstinence in adulthood. A separate cohort of P28 male rats was assayed for object discrimination and BDNF in saliva and the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral striatum. Novel object discrimination correlated positively with salivary BDNF on P20 and dorsolateral striatum levels, but negatively with medial prefrontal cortex BDNF in male rats. In female rats, P20 salivary BDNF negatively correlated with object discrimination. Salivary BDNF positively correlated across age in male rats. Male rats earned more cocaine (0.75 mg/kg) at FR5 and responded more at relapse than did female rats. These elevated relapse rates in male rats were significantly associated with P20 object discrimination and salivary BDNF. Relapse after 0.75 and 0.25 mg/kg in female rats correlated only with object discrimination. In conclusion, poor working memory and low salivary BDNF in juvenile male rats may represent biomarkers for later cocaine use. Further research is needed to identify biomarkers for risk in male rats.

AB  - Background: The increasing use of ketamine as a potential rapid-onset antidepressant necessitates a better understanding of its effects on blood pressure and heart rate, well-known side effects at higher doses. For the subanesthetic dose used for depression, potential predictors of these cardiovascular effects are important factors influencing clinical decisions. Since ketamine influences the sympathetic nervous system, we investigated the impact of autonomic nervous system-related factors on the cardiovascular response: a genetic polymorphism in the norepinephrine transporter and gender effects. Methods: Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored during and following administration of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine or placebo in 68 healthy participants (mean age 26.04 ± 5.562 years) in a double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel-design trial. The influences of baseline blood pressure/heart rate, gender, and of a polymorphism in the norepinephrine transporter gene (NET SLC6A2, rs28386840 [A-3081T]) on blood pressure and heart rate changes were investigated. To quantify changes in blood pressure and heart rate, we calculated the maximum change from baseline (ΔMAX) and the time until maximum change (TΔMAX). Results: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate increased significantly upon ketamine administration, but without reaching hypertensive levels. During administration, the systolic blood pressure at baseline (TP0Sys) correlated negatively with the time to achieve maximal systolic blood pressure (TΔMAXSys, P < .001). Furthermore, women showed higher maximal diastolic blood pressure change (ΔMAXDia, P < .001) and reached this peak earlier than men (TΔMAXDia, P = .017) at administration. NET rs28386840 [T] carriers reached their maximal systolic blood pressure during ketamine administration significantly earlier than [A] homozygous (TΔMAXSys, P = .030). In a combined regression model, both genetic polymorphism and TP0Sys were significant predictors of TΔMAXSys (P < .0005). Conclusions: Subanesthetic ketamine increased both blood pressure and heart rate without causing hypertensive events. Furthermore, we identified gender and NET rs28386840 genotype as factors that predict increased cardiovascular sequelae of ketamine administration in our young, healthy study population providing a potential basis for establishing monitoring guidelines.

AB  - Many recreational ecstasy/MDMA users display neuropsychobiological deficits, whereas others remain problem free. This review will investigate some of the drug and non-drug factors which influence the occurrence of these deficits. Acute and chronic MDMA usage are both important. Intensive use within a session is often associated with more problems. In term of lifetime usage, novice users generally remain unimpaired, whereas most heavy users report memory or other psychobiological problems which they attribute to ecstasy. These complaints are confirmed by objective deficits in working memory, attention, frontal-executive, and episodic memory tasks. Psychobiological deficits include disturbed sleep, sexual dysfunction, reduced immuno-competence, and increased oxidative stress. Further MDMA-related factors which may contribute to these changes, include acute and chronic tolerance, and drug dependence. Around 90-95% of ecstasy/MDMA users also take cannabis, and this can independently contribute to the adverse neuropsychobiological profiles; although in some situations the acute co-use of these two drugs may be interactive rather than additive, since cannabis has relaxant and hypothermic properties. Alcohol, nicotine, amphetamine, and other drugs, can also affect the psychobiological profiles of ecstasy polydrug users in complex ways. Pure MDMA users are rare but they have been shown to display significant neurocognitive deficits. Psychiatric aspects are debated in the context of the diathesis-stress model. Here the stressor of ecstasy polydrug drug use, interacts with various predisposition factors (genetic, neurochemical, personality), to determine the psychiatric outcome. Recreational MDMA is typically taken in hot and crowded dances/raves. Prolonged dancing, feeling hot, and raised body temperature, can also be associated with more psychobiological problems. This is consistent with the animal literature, where high ambient temperature and other metabolic stimulants boost the acute effects of MDMA, and cause greater serotonergic neurotoxicity. In conclusion, the neuropsychobiological effects of MDMA are modulated by a wide range of drug and non-drug factors.

AB  - This study examined the role of protective factors (i.e., social support) and risk factors (i.e., cocaine abuse/dependence) in psychological outcomes (i.e., major depressive disorder, irritable depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder) among racially diverse female survivors of sexual victimization. Archival data from a subsample of participants (n = 1115), those who endorsed experiences of sexual victimization, from the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication, a cross-sectional survey of mental disorders of the general population of the United States, were examined. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine if the predictor variables (i.e., social support and cocaine abuse/dependence) were related to the outcomes variable (i.e., major depressive disorder, irritable depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder) and then to determine if the moderating variable (i.e., race) changed the relationship between the predictor variables and the outcomes variables. Respondents who endorsed sexual victimization and reported experiencing less positive support were more likely to have PTSD. Respondents who endorsed sexual victimization and also met criteria for cocaine abuse/dependence were more likely to have PTSD. Compared to Caucasians, Asian American Pacific Islanders and Latinas were significantly more likely to have experienced PTSD. Limitations and implications are discussed.

AB  - Social stress has been linked to drug use disorders in humans. This dissertation employs mouse models to examine how social defeat stress influences cocaine self-administration and seeking. One of the hypotheses underlying stress effects on drug use disorders is the interaction between stress neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and mesolimbic dopamine system. To assess this hypothesis, I employed social defeat stress in male mice, mimicking some salient features of social stress in humans. In Aim 1 and 2, I evaluated the effects of social stress on cocaine self-administration and focused on the role of CRF and its type 1 receptors (CRF R1) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA, a dopamine-rich brain region). In Aim 3 and 4, I established a stress-induced reinstatement mouse model and further explored the potential stress effects on cocaine seeking behavior. The results demonstrated that repeated intermittent social defeat stress, contributed to the escalation of cocaine self-administration and seeking in male mice. Additionally, these behavior changes were concurrent with increased tonic CRF within the VTA. Moreover, pharmacological manipulations of CRF R1 in the VTA can block the social stress-escalated cocaine self-administration and seeking. However, escalation of cocaine-seeking behaviors was concurrent with decreased extracellular dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh). Together, these findings establish fundamental roles of CRF and CRF R1 in the VTA in mediating repeated social defeat stress escalated cocaine self-administration and cocaine seeking in male mice. CRF-R1 may be a mechanism for balancing the dysregulation of social stress and reward in drug use disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aims: To estimate the prevalence of cocaine binging and examine associated factors, to characterize binge episodes and to study the relationship between cocaine binging and HIV and HCV risk behaviors among street-based cocaine users. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in Montréal, Canada. Interviewer-administered questionnaire were carried out at 3-month intervals. Cocaine binging was defined as using large quantities of cocaine, without stopping, over a limited period of time, until resources run out or until being physically incapable of consuming. Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) analyses were used. Covariates considered included demographic, behavioral, mental health and social risk factors. Findings: In total, 605 participants were recruited. Prevalence of cocaine binging over the month prior to recruitment was 24.5%. Correlates of cocaine binging were older age (AOR 1.46), homelessness (AOR 1.44), criminal/marginal income strategies (AOR 1.61), high psychological distress (AOR 1.31), high cocaine dependence (AOR 3.71), drug overdoses (AOR 1.56) and smoking as the main route of cocaine administration (AOR 1.38). Additional GEE analyses showed that cocaine binging was significantly associated with the sharing of drug paraphernalia (AOR 1.35) and sexual relations under the influence of cocaine (AOR 1.21). Conclusion: Cocaine binging is frequent among street-based cocaine users and is associated with markers of vulnerability. It is also associated with increased odds of both sexual and drug use risk behaviors. Interventions need to be tailored in order to help cocaine bingers develop personal strategies that could prevent binging. Harm reduction programs should help cocaine bingers adequately assess their drug equipment needs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background and Objective: Bupropion is generally considered safe and is widely used both as a monotherapy and as an augmentation agent for the treatment of major depression. Concerns have been raised about bupropion’s propensity to precipitate new psychosis and worsen existing psychotic symptoms, although the mechanism is poorly understood. Three cases are reported in which bupropion use was associated with psychosis. The aim of the study was to explore the risk factors and possible mechanisms of psychosis in each case. Case Reports: Case 1 describes the interaction of cocaine abuse sensitization in a patient who developed psychosis with a lower dosage of bupropion. Cases 2 and 3 discuss the role of traumatic brain injury and structural brain lesions in increasing the risk of psychosis when using bupropion. Conclusions: Cocaine abuse, traumatic brain injury, and preexisting brain lesions appear to be risk factors for developing psychosis in persons taking bupropion. In such cases, clinicians should carefully assess the risks and benefits and closely monitor patients for symptoms of psychosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article examined transition rates of young children (n = 102) from an early intervention program at the Linda Ray Intervention Program (LRIP) who had documented developmental delays and co-occurring prenatal drug exposure often coupled with verified child maltreatment. Findings indicated that there was significant group improvement from entrance to exit across all six Battelle Domains at the p < .05 level. Also, children who were enrolled for a longer period of time saw significantly better adaptive, personal-social, communication, and Battelle total scale scores at the p < .05 level. Finally, data revealed that boys were 5 times more likely than girls to be transitioned to Part B services after exit from LRIP. A longitudinal study of a subgroup of these children indicated that LRIP children who were in grades K–3 needed fewer special education services in elementary school than they needed at age 36 months, indicating a further reduction in special education needs for these children.

AB  - Rationale: Repeated social defeat (RSD) increases the rewarding effects of cocaine in adolescent and adult rodents. Objective: The aim of the present study was to compare the long-term effects of RSD on the conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine and levels of the transcription factors Pitx3 and Nurr1 in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the dopamine transporter (DAT), the D2 dopamine receptor (D2DR) and precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) signaling pathways, and the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in adult and adolescent mice. Methods: Male adolescent and young adult OF1 mice were exposed to four episodes of social defeat and were conditioned 3 weeks later with 1 mg/kg of cocaine. In a second set of mice, the expressions of the abovementioned dopaminergic and proBDNF and TrkB receptor were measured in VTA and NAc, respectively. Results: Adolescent mice experienced social defeats less intensely than their adult counterparts and produced lower levels of corticosterone. However, both adult and adolescent defeated mice developed conditioned place preference for the compartment associated with this low dose of cocaine. Furthermore, only adolescent defeated mice displayed diminished levels of the transcription factors Pitx3 in the VTA, without changes in the expression of DAT and D2DR in the NAc. In addition, stressed adult mice showed a decreased expression of proBDNF and the TrkB receptor, while stressed adolescent mice exhibited increased expression of latter without changes in the former. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that dopaminergic pathways and proBDNF signaling and TrkB receptors play different roles in social defeat-stressed mice exposed to cocaine.

AB  - Assessed patterns of use of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) ('ecstasy'), and the characteristics of users, in a sample of 733 men who have sex with men (aged 18-50+ yrs) in New York City. Among respondents, 13.7% reported using MDMA in the past 6 mo, with mean frequency of use of 6.24 times in that period. MDMA users were found to be younger, less educated, to have had more male partners, more 1 night stands with men, more visits to bars or clubs and sex clubs or bathhouses, to have unprotected anal sex with a male, to be likely to have been the victim of physical domestic violence, to have more gay/bisexual friends, to have disclosed their sexual orientation to more friends, family members, and coworkers, and to have higher levels of gay community participation and affiliation. Among MDMA users, higher frequency of MDMA use was associated with being younger, having more visits to bars or clubs, more gay/bisexual friends, and having an HIV negative test result or never having been tested. MDMA users thus constitute a group at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, and other problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - An antidepressant dose of the rapidly-acting ketamine inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) in mouse hippocampus, and this inhibition is required for the antidepressant effect of ketamine in learned helplessness depression-like behavior. Here we report that treatment with an antidepressant dose of ketamine (10 mg/kg) increased expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) in mouse hippocampus, an effect that required ketamine-induced inhibition of GSK3. Ketamine also inhibited hippocampal GSK3 and increased expression of hippocampal IGF2 in mice when administered after the induction of learned helplessness. Treatment with the specific GSK3 inhibitor L803-mts was sufficient to up-regulate hippocampal IGF2 expression. Administration of IGF2 siRNA reduced ketamine's antidepressant effect in the learned helplessness paradigm. Mice subjected to the learned helplessness paradigm were separated into two groups, those that were resilient (non-depressed) and those that were susceptible (depressed). Non-depressed resilient mice displayed higher expression of IGF2 than susceptible mice. These results indicate that IGF2 contributes to ketamine's antidepressant effect and that IGF2 may confer resilience to depression-like behavior.

AB  - Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) usage is synonymous with trance culture. Qualitative focus groups were conducted with eight young adults who attended trance parties but did not consume MDMA in order to explore protective factors that prevented participants from consuming MDMA. The focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed, using thematic analysis. Five main themes emerged from the analysis. These themes were named as follows: knowledge and beliefs relating to MDMA, fear of losing control, fear of sexual contact, learning from others who have consumed MDMA and self-preservation. Participants overwhelmingly stated that one of the main reasons they did not use MDMA was because it was chemical in nature. However, participants admitted to using cannabis and mushrooms and rationalised this by stating that they were natural. The researchers had difficulty in attaining participants for this study as few people attend trance parties and abstain from using MDMA. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive drug use and chronic relapse despite negative consequences. Drug-induced structural and functional changes in the brain are thought to underlie these characteristics. One mechanism that may mediate these characteristics are growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF2), as they are necessary for cellular growth, survival, differentiation, and have roles in memory, mood, and anxiety disorders. bFGF mRNA and protein expression is increased following stimulant administration and is necessary for stimulant-induced changes in dendrites and behavioral sensitization. Moreover, addiction is maintained by cues associated with the drug, as they can evoke craving and promote relapse. Therefore, reducing cue reactivity, such as with extinction, could reduce relapse rates. Inhibiting bFGF in the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL-mPFC), following self-administration, facilitates extinction. Extinction of drug seeking can reduce bFGF expression in IL-mPFC, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and dorsal hippocampus (dHipp), indicating that bFGF may mediate drug-associated learning. However, the circuitry and mechanisms underlying extinction and the role of bFGF is unknown. Therefore, the current experiments investigated if drug-induced plasticity was altered by extinction and if bFGF had a role, in brain regions associated with learning or addiction (i.e., IL-mPFC, NAc, and dHipp). We found that cocaine self-administration induced changes in plasticity-related protein expression, such as ARC and pGSK3beta, in each brain region, and extinction could ameliorate some of that plasticity. Moreover, we found that neutralizing bFGF in NAc prior to four 30-min extinction sessions disrupted initial extinction retention. However, if bFGF was neutralized without four 30-min extinction sessions, subsequent extinction was enhanced. In dHipp, neutralizing bFGF, with or without four 30-min extinction sessions, facilitated subsequent extinction over days. Overall, these results suggest that blocking the biological function of bFGF in a number of reward- and learning-related brain regions can facilitate subsequent extinction. Understanding the neuronal mechanisms by which bFGF regulates extinction at systems and molecular levels will allow for development of new pharmacotherapeutics to enhance extinction-based therapies for addiction.

AB  - Diminished adult neurogenesis is known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of diverse neurodegenerative disorders such as HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). Cocaine, often abused by HIV-infected patients, has been suggested to worsen HIV-associated CNS disease. Mounting evidence also indicates that HIV infection can lead not only to neuronal dysfunction or loss, but can also negatively impact neurogenesis, resulting in generation of fewer adult neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, brain area critical for memory and learning. The crucial role of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in providing tropic support for the neurons as well as in promoting NPC proliferation has been demonstrated by us previously. However, whether PDGF-BB regulates neuronal differentiation especially in the context of HAND and drug abuse remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that pretreatment of rat hippocampal NPCs with PDGF-BB restored neuronal differentiation that had been impaired by HIV Tat and cocaine. To further study the intracellular mechanism(s) involved in this process, we examined the role of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels in mediating neuronal differentiation in the presence of PDGF-BB. TRPC channels are Ca2+-permeable, nonselective cationic channels that elicit a variety of physiological functions. Parallel but distinct ERK, Akt signaling pathways with downstream activation of CREB were found to be critical for neuronal differentiation. Pharmacological blocking of TRPC channels resulted in suppression of PDGF-mediated differentiation and PDGF-BB-induced activation of ERK and Akt, culminating also to inhibition of PDGF-induced activation of CREB. Taken together, these findings underpin the role of TRPC channel as a novel target regulating cell differentiation mediated by PDGF-BB. This finding could have implications for development of therapeutic interventions aimed at restoration of Tat and cocaine-mediated impairment of neurogenesis in drug abusing HAND patients.

AB  - We sought to identify behavioral factors associated with response to an employment-based intervention in which participants had to provide drug-free urine samples to gain access to paid employment. The present secondary analysis included data from a randomized clinical trial. The trial evaluated whether employment-based reinforcement could decrease cocaine use in community methadone patients. Participants (N = 56) in the trial worked in a model workplace for 4 hr every weekday and earned about $10 per hr. After a 4-week baseline, participants were randomly assigned to an abstinence-and-work (n = 28) or work-only (n = 28) condition and could work for an additional 26 weeks. Abstinence-and-work participants had to provide cocaine-negative urine samples to work and maintain maximum pay. Work-only participants only had to work to earn pay. For work-only participants, cocaine abstinence during baseline and the intervention period were significantly correlated (rs = .72, p < .001). For abstinence-and-work participants, baseline opiate abstinence was significantly correlated (rs = .59, p < .001) and workplace attendance was marginally correlated (rs = .32, p = .098) with cocaine abstinence during the intervention period. Furthermore, participants who provided over 60% cocaine-negative urine samples during the intervention period (i.e., responders) had significantly higher baseline rates of opiate abstinence (p < .0001) and workplace attendance (p = .042) than did nonresponders. Employment-based reinforcement of cocaine abstinence may be improved by increasing opiate abstinence and workplace attendance prior to initiating the cocaine-abstinence intervention.

AB  - Intermittent social defeat stress escalates later cocaine self-administration. Reward and stress both activate ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, increasing downstream extracellular dopamine concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. The stress neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and its receptors (CRF-R1, CRF-R2) are located in the VTA and influence dopaminergic activity. These experiments explore how CRF release and the activation of its receptors within the VTA both during and after stress influence later cocaine self-administration in rats. In vivo microdialysis of CRF in the VTA demonstrated that CRF is phasically released in the posterior VTA (pVTA) during acute defeat, but, with repeated defeat, CRF is recruited into the anterior VTA (aVTA) and CRF tone is increased in both subregions. Intra-VTA antagonism of CRF-R1 in the pVTA and CRF-R2 in the aVTA during each social defeat prevented escalated cocaine self-administration in a 24 h 'binge.' VTA CRF continues to influence cocaine seeking in stressed animals long after social defeat exposure. Unlike nonstressed controls, previously stressed rats show significant cocaine seeking after 15 d of forced abstinence. Previously stressed rats continue to express elevated CRF tone within the VTA and antagonism of pVTA CRF-R1 or aVTA CRF-R2 reverses cocaine seeking. In conclusion, these experiments demonstrate neuroadaptive changes in tonic and phasic CRF with repeated stress, that CRF release during stress may contribute to later escalated cocaine taking, and that persistently elevated CRF tone in the VTA may drive later cocaine seeking through increased activation of pVTA CRF-R1 and aVTA CRF-R2.

AB  - Methylphenidate (MPH) occupies brain striatal dopamine transporters (DATs) and is an effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, patients with ADHD and comorbid cocaine dependence do not benefit significantly from treatment with MPH. To better understand the neurobiology of this phenomenon, we examined DAT availability and the effects of MPH treatment on DAT occupancy in ADHD patients with and without cocaine dependence. ADHD patients without a comorbid substance use disorder (N = 16) and ADHD patients with comorbid cocaine dependence (N = 8) were imaged at baseline and after two weeks MPH treatment using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with the DAT tracer [¹²³I]FP-CIT. Changes in ADHD symptoms were measured with the ADHD symptom rating scale (ASRS). At baseline, we observed lower striatal DAT availability in ADHD patients with cocaine dependence. Following fixed MPH treatment, MPH occupied significantly less striatal DATs in cocaine-dependent than in non-cocaine dependent ADHD patients. There were no significant correlations between baseline DAT availability or DAT occupancy by MPH and ADHD symptom improvement. However, we did find significant correlations between DAT occupancy by MPH and decreases in impulsivity scores and years of cocaine use. These preliminary findings suggest that low DAT occupancy is not the reason why ADHD patients with cocaine dependence do not benefit from MPH treatment. It also suggests that higher dosages of MPH in these patients are probably not the solution and that medications directed at other pharmacological targets should be considered in these comorbid ADHD patients.

AB  - The objective of this study, which targeted long-term socially integrated cocaine users (in powder form, no heroin), was to analyze potential determinants of request for treatment for primary cocaine abuse. Two hundred and twenty-three cases (users who sought treatment for primary cocaine abuse) and 223 controls (users who did not seek treatment) were interviewed in Italy. A semistructured interview was created. Conditional logistic regression models were used. Cases had begun consuming illicit substances later, started using cocaine quicker, had high-risk drinking habits, had more intense recent use of cocaine, and used alone and at work. Some of the motivations of use that characterize subjects who seek treatment (to experience a ‘high’, disinhibition, avoidance, and to feel more confident) seem specifically to obtain immediate gratification, without concern for future consequences. Variability in cocaine abusers seeking treatment has been a long-recognized feature of this population and the results show that the appropriate target population (cocaine users experiencing problems and using more frequently) is reached by treatment services.

AB  - In the brain, astrocytes signal to neighboring cells via regulated exocytotic release of gliosignaling molecules, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Recent studies uncovered a role of ketamine, an anesthetic and antidepressant, in the regulation of BDNF expression and in the disruption of astrocytic Ca2+ signaling, but it is unclear whether it affects astroglial BDNF release. We investigated whether ketamine affects ATP-evoked Ca2+ signaling and exocytotic release of BDNF at the single-vesicle level in cultured rat astrocytes. Cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding preproBDNF tagged with the pH-sensitive fluorescent protein superecliptic pHluorin, (BDNF-pHse) to load vesicles and measure the release of BDNF-pHse when the exocytotic fusion pore opens and alkalinizes the luminal pH. In addition, cell-attached membrane capacitance changes were recorded to monitor unitary vesicle interaction with the plasma membrane. Intracellular Ca2+ activity was monitored with Fluo-4 and confocal microscopy, which was also used to immunocytochemically characterize BDNF-pHse-laden vesicles. As revealed by double-fluorescent micrographs, BDNF-pHse localized to vesicles positive for the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), VAMP3, and synaptotagmin IV. Ketamine treatment decreased the number of ATP-evoked BDNF-pHse fusion/secretion events (P < 0.05), the frequency of ATP-evoked transient (P < 0.001) and full-fusion exocytotic (P < 0.05) events, along with a reduction in the ATP-evoked increase in intracellular Ca2+ activity in astrocytes by ~70 % (P < 0.001). The results show that ketamine treatment suppresses ATP-triggered vesicle fusion and BDNF secretion by increasing the probability of a narrow fusion pore open state and/or by reducing astrocytic Ca2+ excitability.

AB  - Background: Recreational ketamine use may be modulated by factors such as ketamine infusion patterns, associated conditioned stimuli and spatial-temporal contexts. Our aim was to study the pharmacological and non-pharmacological factors that regulate the acquisition of ketamine use.Methods: In experiment 1, four groups of male rats were trained to self-administer ketamine during nine 1-h daily sessions, under four reinforcement schedules: i) pre-session ketamine priming (Priming-[KET]), ii) conditioned stimulus (CS) paired to the ketamine infusions ([KET + CS]), iii) neither priming nor CS ([KET]), iv) combination of both (Priming-[KET + CS]). In experiment 2, two groups of male rats were trained to self-administer ketamine during nine 1-h daily or weekly sessions, under the Priming-[KET + CS] schedule. Lever pressing was then extinguished by saline substitution for ketamine infusion. Afterwards, ketamine was made available again upon responding under the same schedule.Results: The Priming-[KET + CS] schedule of reinforcement showed a significant increase in the number of ketamine reinforcements and a significant discrimination between active vs. inactive levers. The same schedule allowed the establishment of ketamine self-administration on a weekly basis. During the extinction phase, rate of responding significantly dropped in both weekly and daily groups although it was twofold longer in the former, which showed a lack of reacquisition.Conclusions: Both pre-session ketamine priming and a conditioned stimulus paired to the ketamine infusions are required for the acquisition of ketamine self-administration. The longer extinction and the lack of reacquisition in the weekly group could be due to changes in temporal context that might affect the conditioning process.

AB  - Withdrawal from chronic d-amphetamine (D-AMPH) can induce negative emotional states, which may contribute to relapse and the maintenance of addiction. Diminished levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), particularly in the hippocampus has been observed after exposure to stress, and recent data indicate that treatment with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, ketamine may reverse these changes. However, it is unclear whether BDNF levels in the hippocampus or other regions of the limbic system are altered following the stress of D-AMPH withdrawal and it is not currently known if treatment with ketamine has any effect on these changes. The goals of this study were to examine BDNF levels throughout the limbic system following D-AMPH withdrawal and determine whether ketamine treatment would alter D-AMPH-induced changes in BDNF. Sprague–Dawley rats were treated with D-AMPH and BDNF protein examined in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and hippocampus at 24 h and 4 days of withdrawal. Our data show that at 24 h post-D-AMPH, BDNF levels were increased in the nucleus accumbens and decreased in the hippocampus. At 4d post-D-AMPH, BDNF protein levels were decreased in all areas examined, and these decreases were reversed by treatment with ketamine. These data suggest that diminished BDNF may contribute to the negative affect seen following D-AMPH withdrawal, and that ketamine treatment could offer relief from these symptoms.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate the serum level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a group of chronic ketamine abusers in comparison to healthy controls. Methods: Eighty-one ketamine abusers who were hospitalized for the treatment of ketamine dependence and 39 healthy controls were recruited. Serum VEGF level was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Psychopathological symptoms were assessed using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Results: Serum level of VEGF was significantly lower in chronic ketamine abusers compared to healthy controls (64.6 ± 42.1 vs. 92.4 ± 59.4pg/ml, F = 7.243, p = 0.008). Conclusions: Serum level of VEGF decreased in chronic ketamine abusers compared to healthy controls. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is linked to numerous brain functions. In addition, BDNF alterations contribute to neurological, mental, and addictive disorders Cocaine dependence has received much attention recently due to its prevalence and psychological effects. Symptoms of psychosis are one of the most serious adverse events precipitated by cocaine use. It is particularly important to identify patients at risk of developing cocaine-induced psychosis (CIP). We described two cases of patients with cocaine dependence who presented with CIP and had changes in their BDNF levels during the psychotic episode. BDNF levels were initially low in both patients, and then decreased by more than 50% in association with CIP. The relationship between BDNF and psychosis is described in the literature. These cases revealed that BDNF levels decreased during a CIP episode and, thus, it is necessary to investigate BDNF and its relationship with CIP further.

AB  - In a preclinical model developed in the Carelli lab, when a palatable saccharin solution predicts impending, but delayed, cocaine availability the saccharin solution becomes devalued, as evidenced by the emergence of aversive taste reactivity during intraoral tastant infusion (Wheeler et al. 2008, 2011). Importantly, this negative affective state predicts the motivation to self-administer cocaine. The primary goal of this work is to extend the current knowledge of this preclinical model of natural reward devaluation and examine several other variables that may influence this process. In the original set of studies (Wheeler et al., 2008, 2011) only a single dose of cocaine was used. The first aim examined if rats receiving varying doses (0.167, 0.33, 0.66 mg/inf) of cocaine paired to the same concentration of saccharin (0.15%), would alter taste reactivity to the predictive cue in a dose-dependent manner. This study revealed that the emergence of negative affect and the associated increase in motivation for the drug was not dependent on cocaine dose. Exercise has been shown to reduce cocaine-seeking in animal models. Additional studies examined if exercise (i.e., access to a running wheel in their home cage), either following (Aim 2) or prior to (Aim 3) training on the preclinical model would reverse or attenuate the development of the negative affective state, and the motivation to consume cocaine. The results of Aim 2 indicate a trend toward a protective effect against the established negative affective state, however these results were not strong. Further, exercise had some protective effect against the motivation to consume cocaine when rats were reintroduced to the paradigm, although it did not completely reverse the negative affective state. The results of Aim 3 showed exercise does have a protective effect against the development of the negative affective state in this model, however, the motivation to consume cocaine continued after it had developed. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that although the development of the negative affective state observed in our preclinical model is not cocaine dose-dependent, it can be altered to some degree by physical activity.

AB  - Stress rapidly and potently excites certain dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), promoting phasic dopamine increases in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh). Repeated stressful episodes have been linked to addiction both clinically and preclinically, so stress-induced activation of this mesocorticolimbic dopamine system may trigger long-term changes leading to later heightened vulnerability to addiction. One possible mediator of this VTA dopamine activation is the stress neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), but the interactions of CRF and VTA dopamine neurons during stress have received only limited attention. This dissertation explores interactions of CRF and dopamine neurons in the VTA during acute stress (Aim 1) and repeated stress (Aim 2), as well as how these interactions can affect later reward-related behaviors and neurochemistry (Aim 3). Specifically, this work demonstrates that extracellular dopamine is increased in both the mPFC and NAcSh during acute social defeat, which is paralleled by increased extracellular CRF within the posterior, but not anterior VTA. Intra-VTA antagonism of CRF-R2, but not CRF-R1, prevents acute social defeat stress-induced dopamine efflux in the NAcSh, but not mPFC. Repeated stress results in increased tonic CRF within the VTA, and a shift to a phasic response in the anterior, but not posterior, VTA during stress. Additionally, the non-habituated dopaminergic increases in both the mPFC and NAcSh during repeated defeat are prevented with intra-VTA CRF-R2 antagonism. However, intra-VTA antagonism of both CRF-R1 and CRF-R2 prior to social defeat prevents the induction of neural cross-sensitization to cocaine as well as escalated cocaine self-administration during a 24 h 'binge'. Finally, this work shows that VTA CRF and its receptors play a long-lasting role in cocaine seeking, such that increased extracellular CRF tone within the VTA of previously stressed animals drives augmented context-induced reinstatement to cocaine seeking after abstinence, an effect which can be prevented with intra-VTA antagonism of both CRF-R1 and CRF-R2 prior to reinstatement testing. Together, these data establish a fundamental role of CRF and its receptors in the VTA in mediating dopaminergic function during stress, promoting long lasting neural adaptations of mesocorticolimbic circuitry traditionally associated with reward.

AB  - Objectives: Underlying heterogeneity among individuals with cocaine dependence is widely postulated in the literature; however, identification of a group of factors that explain risk of cocaine use severity has yet to be confirmed. Methods: Latent mixture modeling evaluated 338 cocaine-dependent individuals recruited from the community to assess the evidence for the presence of distinct subgroups. Variables included 5 baseline questionnaires measuring cognitive function (Shipley), impulsivity (BIS), mood (BDI), affective lability (ALS), and addiction severity (ASI). Results failed to suggest multiple subgroups. Given a lack of evidence for discrete latent classes, an exploratory factor analysis followed by exploratory structural equation modeling was implemented to identify functional dimensions to enhance interpretation of these variables. Results: Findings from the exploratory factor analysis indicated a 3-factor model as the best fit, and the subsequent exploratory structural equation modeling solution resulted in associations with lifetime cocaine use. Factor 1, best characterized by demographic factors (sex and age), is associated with less lifetime cocaine use. Psychological problems best characterize factor 2, which is associated with higher lifetime cocaine use. Finally, factor 3 is characterized by other substance use (alcohol and marijuana). Although this factor did not demonstrate a statistically reliable relation with self reported, lifetime cocaine use, it did indicate a potentially meaningful positive association. Conclusions: These 3 factors delineate dimensions of functioning that likewise help characterize the variability found in previously established associations with selfreported cocaine use.

AB  - Drug exposure results in structural and functional changes in brain regions that regulate reward and these changes may underlie the persistence of compulsive drug seeking and relapse. Neurotrophic factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF2), are necessary for neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation, and may contribute to these drug-induced changes. Following cocaine exposure, bFGF is increased in addiction-related brain regions, including the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL-mPFC). The IL-mPFC is necessary for extinction, but whether drug-induced overexpression of bFGF in this region affects extinction of drug seeking is unknown. Thus, we determined whether blocking bFGF in IL-mPFC would facilitate extinction following cocaine self-administration. Rats were trained to lever press for intravenous infusions of cocaine before extinction. Blocking bFGF in IL-mPFC before four extinction sessions resulted in facilitated extinction. In contrast, blocking bFGF alone was not sufficient to facilitate extinction, as blocking bFGF and returning rats to their home cage had no effect on subsequent extinction. Furthermore, bFGF protein expression increased in IL-mPFC following cocaine self-administration, an effect reversed by extinction. These results suggest that cocaine-induced overexpression of bFGF inhibits extinction, as blocking bFGF during extinction permits rapid extinction. Therefore, targeted reductions in bFGF during therapeutic interventions could enhance treatment outcomes for addiction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background/Aims: Considering the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in memory processes and its peripheral response during the detoxification of cocaine, the aim of this study was to investigate whether plasma BDNF levels could be related to memory performance in women with crack/cocaine dependence. Methods: Twenty-five abstinent female crack/cocaine users (CCD) and 25 unmedicated healthy women (HW), carefully matched for age and years of formal education, were assessed regarding memory performance. Logical Memory was used to assess the immediate verbal recall (IVR), delayed verbal recall (DVR) and memory retention. Plasma BDNF levels were measured by Elisa immunoassay. Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms, and the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment the severity of cocaine abstinence symptoms. Results: The CCD group had lower DVR scores and higher plasma BDNF levels when compared to HW group. In addition, a linear regression model showed that BDNF levels predicted DVR scores within CCD group independently of depressive symptoms (R = 0.51; R² = 0.26; t(22) = 4.025, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Despite higher plasma BDNF levels, crack users exhibited memory impairments when compared to healthy women. Specifically, peripheral BDNF levels predicted better cognitive performance only within individuals who already had cognitive impairment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Release of the neuropeptides corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and orexin-A in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play an important role in stress-induced cocaine-seeking behavior. We provide evidence for pharmacologically significant interactions between CRF and orexin-A that depend on oligomerization of CRF₁ receptor (CRF₁R) and orexin OX₁ receptors (OX1R). CRF₁R–OX₁R heteromers are the conduits of a negative crosstalk between orexin-A and CRF as demonstrated in transfected cells and rat VTA, in which they significantly modulate dendritic dopamine release. The cocaine target σ₁ receptor (σ₁R) also associates with the CRF₁R–OX₁R heteromer. Cocaine binding to the σ₁R–CRF₁R–OX₁R complex promotes a long-term disruption of the orexin-A–CRF negative crosstalk. Through this mechanism, cocaine sensitizes VTA cells to the excitatory effects of both CRF and orexin-A, thus providing a mechanism by which stress induces cocaine seeking.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) overdiagnosis and a pharmacological attempt to increase cognitive performance, are the major causes for the frequent (ab)use of psychostimulants in non-ADHD individuals. Methylphenidate is a non-addictive psychostimulant, although its mode of action resembles that of cocaine, a well-known addictive and abused drug. Neuronal- and glial-derived growth factors play a major role in the development, maintenance and survival of neurons in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that methylphenidate and cocaine treatment affect the expression of such growth factors. Beginning on postnatal day (PND) 14, male Sprague Dawley rats were treated chronically with either cocaine or methylphenidate. The rats were examined behaviorally and biochemically at several time points (PND 35, 56, 70 and 90). On PND 56, rats treated with cocaine or methylphenidate from PND 14 through PND 35 exhibited increased hippocampal glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mRNA levels, after 21 withdrawal days, compared to the saline-treated rats. We found a significant association between cocaine and methylphenidate treatments and age progression in the prefrontal protein expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Neither treatments affected the behavioral parameters, although acute cocaine administration was associated with increased locomotor activity. It is possible that the increased hippocampal GDNF mRNA levels, may be relevant to the reduced rate of drug seeking behavior in ADHD adolescence that were maintained from childhood on methylphenidate. BDNF protein level increase with age, as well as following stimulant treatments at early age may be relevant to the neurobiology and pharmacotherapy of ADHD.

AB  - Aims: The health hazards and prevalence of ecstasy use have been documented in two decades of research, but no review reporting on potentially modifiable antecedents of use is available. The aim of this study was to integrate systematically research identifying cognitive correlates of ecstasy use. Such research has the potential to identify targets for evidence-based interventions designed to discourage use. Methods: The databases PsycINFO and MedLine were searched, inclusion criteria applied to resulting hits, and descendency and ancestry approaches applied to the selected publications. Reported associations between cognitive determinants, including intention to use and ecstasy use measures, were synthesized by calculating a weighted mean effect size, r. Results: The pattern of associations lent support both to the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the expectancy approach as descriptions of potentially useful determinants. Attitudes were associated most strongly with intention and use, followed by subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. Conclusions: Consideration of the strength of associations and the potential modifiability of identified cognitions suggests that evidence-based interventions to discourage ecstasy use should target negative expectancies, perceived behavioural control and anticipated regret, and consider tailoring perceived behavioural control elements.

AB  - The current study aimed to elucidate the role of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and neurotransmitter efflux in explaining variability in (±) 3, 4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) self‐administration in rats. PK profiles of MDMA and its major metabolites were determined after the administration of 1.0 mg/kg MDMA (iv) prior to, and following, the acquisition of MDMA self‐administration. Synaptic levels of 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5HT) and dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens were measured following administration of MDMA (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, iv) using in vivo microdialysis and compared for rats that acquired or failed to acquire MDMA self‐administration. Effects of the 5HT neurotoxin, 5,7 dihydroxytryptamine (5, 7‐DHT), on the acquisition of MDMA and cocaine self‐administration were also determined. In keeping with previous findings, approximately 50% of rats failed to meet a criterion for acquisition of MDMA self‐administration. The PK profiles of MDMA and its metabolites did not differ between rats that acquired or failed to acquire MDMA self‐administration. MDMA produced more overflow of 5HT than DA. The MDMA‐induced 5HT overflow was lower in rats that acquired MDMA self‐administration compared with those that did not acquire self‐administration. In contrast, MDMA‐induced DA overflow was comparable for the two groups. Prior 5,7‐DHT lesions reduced tissue levels of 5HT and markedly increased the percentage of rats that acquired MDMA self‐administration and also decreased the latency to acquisition of cocaine self‐administration. These data suggest that 5HT limits the initial sensitivity to the positively reinforcing effects of MDMA and delays the acquisition of reliable self‐administration.

AB  - Aims: This study investigated the serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in a group of chronic ketamine abusers in comparison to healthy controls. The correlations between the serum BDNF, NGF level with the subjects’ demographic, pattern of ketamine use were also examined. Methods: 93 subjects who met the criteria of ketamine dependence and 39 healthy subjects were recruited. Serum BDNF and NGF levels were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Psychopathological symptoms were assessed using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Results: Both serum levels of BDNF and NGF were significant lower in the ketamine users compared to the healthy control subjects (9.50 ± 6.68 versus 14.37 ± 6.07ng/ml, p = 0.019 for BDNF; 1.93 ± 0.80 versus 2.60 ± 1.07ng/ml, p = 0.011 for NGF). BDNF level was negatively associated with current frequency of ketamine use (r = −0.209, p = 0.045). Conclusions: Both BDNF and NGF serum concentrations were significantly lower among chronic ketamine users than among health controls. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study was aimed to examine the Attitudes-Social influence-Efficacy Model for the use of MDMA among college students in Taiwan. A representative sample of 3743 college students participated in this study. Each participant completed a comprehensive survey and 3090 valid data were collected. Correlation analyses displayed that either positive outcome expectancy or social influence was positively related to intention while refusal self-efficacy was negatively associated with intention. Using the Structural Equation Model, the results showed that the model fitted the data well. Intention for using MDMA affected MDMA use. Refusing self-efficacy significantly predicted intention and MDMA use indirectly via intention. Social influence had a direct impact on intention or MDMA use as well as an indirect effect on MDMA use via intention. However, positive outcome expectancy did not have an effect on both intention and the use of MDMA. Our results suggested that preventive programs in colleges for MDMA use should focus on developing strategies in decreasing the social influence and enhancing the refusal self-efficacy.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the incidence and correlates of cocaine injection initiation and the impacts of daily cocaine injection among a cohort of injection drug users. Methods: Among 1603 participants, from May 1996 to December 2005, risk factors for initiation of cocaine injection among baseline heroin users were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression and correlates of daily cocaine injection by generalized estimating equations. Findings: Of the 238 individuals who had never injected cocaine, 200 (84%) had at least one follow-up visit and 121 (61%) consequently initiated into cocaine injection, yielding an incidence density of initiation into cocaine injection of 21.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 17.9–25.8) per 100 person-years. In a multivariate model, Downtown Eastside (DTES) residence (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.68–3.60), incarceration (AHR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.01–2.24), requiring help injecting (AHR = 1.57, 95% CI: 0.99–2.49), and binge drug use (AHR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.22–2.73) remained associated with initiation into cocaine injection. DTES residence (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.62–2.46), unstable housing (AOR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04–1.53), incarceration (AOR= 1.29, 95% CI: 1.04–1.60), sex trade involvement (AOR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.15–1.85), requiring help injecting (AOR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.73–2.58)), borrowing syringes (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.35–2.43) and binge drug use (AOR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.81–2.58) were independently associated with daily cocaine injection. Conclusions: The baseline prevalence and subsequent incidence of initiation into cocaine injection was high. Daily cocaine injection was independently associated with a number of health and social harms, including elevated HIV risk behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in cocaine craving in humans and drug seeking in rodents. Based on this, the aim of this study was to explore the possible role of serum BDNF in cocaine relapse in abstinent addicts. Forty cocaine dependent subjects (DSM-IV criteria) were included in an inpatient 2 weeks abstinence program. Organic and psychiatric co-morbidities were excluded. Two serum samples were collected for each subject at baseline and at after 14 abstinence days. After discharge, all cocaine addicts underwent a 22 weeks follow-up, after which they were classified into early relapsers (ER) (resumed during the first 14 days after discharge,) or late relapsers (LR) (resumed beyond 14 days after discharge). The only clinical differences between groups were the number of consumption days during the last month before detoxification. Serum BDNF levels increased significantly across the 12 days of abstinence in the LR group (p=0.02), whereas in the ER group BDNF remained unchanged. In the ER group, the change of serum BDNF during abstinence negatively correlated with the improvement in depressive symptoms (p=0.02). These results suggest that BDNF has a role in relapse to cocaine consumption in abstinent addicts, although the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain to be clarified.

AB  - Rationale: During adolescence, the brain is maturing and more sensitive to drugs of abuse that can influence its developmental trajectory. Recently, attention has been focused on basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) given that its administration early in life enhances the acquisition of cocaine self-administration and sensitization at adulthood (Turner et al. (Pharmacol Biochem Behav 92:100–4, 2009), Clinton et al. (Pharmacol Biochem Behav 103:6–17, 2012)). Additionally, we found that abstinence from adolescent cocaine exposure long lastingly dysregulates FGF-2 transcription (Giannotti et al. (Psychopharmacology (Berl) 225:553–60, 2013). Objectives: The objectives of the study are to evaluate if (1) a single injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg) at postnatal day 35 alters FGF-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and (2) the first injection influences the trophic response to a second injection (10 mg/kg) provided 24 h or 7 days later. Results: We found regional differences in the FGF-2 expression pattern as either the first or the second injection of cocaine by themselves upregulated FGF-2 mRNA in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens while downregulating it in the hippocampus. The first injection influences the trophic response of the second. Of note, 24 h after the first injection, accumbal and hippocampal FGF-2 changes produced by cocaine in saline-pretreated rats were prevented in cocaine-pretreated rats. Conversely, in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus 7 days after the first injection, the cocaine-induced FGF-2 changes were modified by the subsequent exposure to the psychostimulant. Conclusions: These findings show that a single cocaine injection is sufficient to produce enduring changes in the adolescent brain and indicate that early cocaine priming alters the mechanisms regulating the trophic response in a brain region-specific fashion.

AB  - Background: Dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex-nucleus accumbens pathway has been implicated in cocaine addiction. We have previously demonstrated that one intra-dorsomedial prefrontal cortex brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) infusion immediately following the last cocaine self-administration session caused a long-lasting inhibition of cocaine-seeking and normalized the cocaine-induced disturbance of glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens after extinction and a cocaine prime. However, the molecular mechanism mediating the brain-derived neurotrophic factor effect on cocaine-induced alterations in extracellular glutamate levels is unknown. Methods: In the present study, we determined the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor on cocaine-induced changes in the phosphorylation of synapsin (p-synapsin), a family of presynaptic proteins that mediate synaptic vesicle mobilization, in the nucleus accumbens during early withdrawal. Results: Two hours after cocaine self-administration, p-synapsin Ser9 and p-synapsin Ser62/67, but not p-synapsin Ser603, were increased in the nucleus accumbens. At 22 hours, only p-synapsin Ser9 was still elevated. Elevations at both time points were attenuated by an intra-dorsomedial prefrontal cortex brain-derived neurotrophic factor infusion immediately after the end of cocaine self-administration. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor also reduced cocaine self-administration withdrawal-induced phosphorylation of the protein phosphatase 2A C-subunit, suggesting that brain-derived neurotrophic factor disinhibits protein phosphatase 2A C-subunit, consistent with p-synapsin Ser9 dephosphorylation. Further, co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that protein phosphatase 2A C-subunit and synapsin are associated in a protein-protein complex that was reduced after 2 hours of withdrawal from cocaine self-administration and reversed by brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings demonstrate that brain-derived neurotrophic factor normalizes the cocaine self-administration–induced elevation of p-synapsin in nucleus accumbens that may underlie a disturbance in the probability of neurotransmitter release or represent a compensatory neuroadaptation in response to the hypofunction within the prefrontal cortex-nucleus accumbens pathway during cocaine withdrawal.

AB  - Aim: To gain more insight into the reasons and motives why people do not start taking ecstasy. Method: As part of the NeXT Study, we prospectively monitored 188 subjects who were ecstasy-naive at baseline but seemed likely to take ecstasy (MDMA) of their own accord during the course of the study. After an 11- to 26-month follow-up period, 160 respondents remained (85.1%). Among these, 65 participants started taking ecstasy (novel ecstasy users, NEUs) and 95 did not (persistent non-users, PNUs). Several times during their participation, subjects completed lists of reasons and motives for not taking ecstasy. Findings: Principal components analysis identified three main factors associated with non-use: rationality (factor score 0.491), lack of opportunity (0.229) and fear of the effects of ecstasy (0.211). At baseline, PNUs scored higher than NEUs on all three factors. For the NEUs, no significant changes occurred over the course of the study in all three factor curves. Slight shifts were seen for PNUs—the fear of effects diminished and lack of opportunity grew; scores on rationality remained constant. Conclusions: NEUs and PNUs were distinguished most clearly by their factor scores on rationality. Some valuable insights for prevention are discussed.

AB  - Aims: The aims of the present study were to: (i) evaluate the prevalence of recent cocaine use in adolescents and young adults who had died by sudden cardiovascular death (SCVD); (ii) assess if recent cocaine use was associated with an increased risk of SCVD; and (iii) determine the demographic, clinical–pathological and toxicological characteristics of SCVD related to recent cocaine use. Design: This was a case–control autopsy‐based observational retrospective study. Setting/Cases: Cases were all SCVD in individuals aged between 15 and 49 years during the period ranging from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2009, with autopsies performed in Biscay, Spain. Medico‐legal sudden deaths not due to cardiovascular diseases (SnoCVD) were used as the control group. In all deaths a complete autopsy and toxicological and histopathological studies were carried out. Recent cocaine use was considered when cocaine and/or benzoylecgonine were detected in blood. Measurements: The risk for SCVD according to demographic variables (sex and age), cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes and smoking) and toxicological variables (opioids, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, cannabis and alcohol) was analysed using three logistic regression models. We also estimated the prevalence of recent cocaine use in the general population aged 15–49 years based on the projection of population surveys. Findings: Recent cocaine use was significantly higher in the SCVD group (27 of 311 subjects, 9%) than in the SnoCVD group (three of 126 subjects, 2%). In a full logistic regression controlling for all recorded covariates, the main risk factor for SCVD was recent cocaine use (odds ratio 4.10; 95% confidence interval 1.12–15.0). Compared with the estimated data in the general population, the prevalence of recent cocaine use was 13–58 times higher in people with SCVD. Conclusions: Recent cocaine use is associated significantly with an increased risk for sudden cardiovascular death in people aged 15–49 years.

AB  - In Spain, crack cocaine use is silently increasing. In Barcelona, an intentional sample was selected to describe the general characteristics of this consumption. Participants were submitted to an interview and data were analyzed through qualitative research procedures. Users are young males and of low socioeconomic status and formal education. The major pattern of use is compulsive. Illegal income activities are the choice for crack cocaine or money acquisition, increasing individual and social health costs. Polydrug use is a matter of concern. Although these findings can not be generalized, they should be considered for the development of public policies to adequately address crack cocaine users’ needs.

AB  - The teneurin c-terminal associated peptides (TCAP) have been implicated in the regulation of the stress response, possibly via a corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-related mechanism. We have previously shown that repeated intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of TCAP-1 attenuate the reinstatement of cocaine seeking by CRF in rats. Here, we determined whether intravenous (IV) administrations of TCAP-1 would likewise attenuate CRF-induced reinstatement, and whether this effect would vary depending on the rat's history of cocaine self administration. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 10 days, during once daily sessions that were either 3h ('short access'; ShA) or 6h ('long access'; LgA). Rats were then given five daily injections of TCAP-1 (0, 300, or 3000 pmol, IV) in their home cage. Subsequently, they were returned to the self-administration chambers where extinction of cocaine seeking and testing for CRF-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking was carried out. Repeated IV administrations of TCAP-1 were efficacious in attenuating CRF-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, but at different doses in ShA and LgA rats. Taken together, the findings extend previous work showing a consistent effect of repeated ICV TCAP-1 on CRF-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, and point to a potential therapeutic benefit of TCAP-1 in attenuating cocaine seeking behaviors.

AB  - Crack/cocaine and engagement in risky sexual behavior represent important contributors to the escalation of the HIV infection among women. Several lines of research have emphasized the role of social factors in women’s vulnerability for such practices and stressed the importance of understanding such factors to better inform prevention efforts and improve their effectiveness and efficiency. However, few studies have attempted to pinpoint specific social/contextual factors particularly relevant to high-risk populations such as female crack/cocaine users. Extensive previous research has related the experience of social rejection to a variety of negative outcomes including, but not limited to, various forms of psychopathology, self-defeating, and self-harm behavior. Motivated by this research, the current study explored the role of laboratory-induced social rejection in moderating the relationship between gender and risky sexual behavior among a sample of crack/cocaine users (n = 211) at high risk for HIV. The results showed that among women, but not among men, experiencing social rejection was significantly associated with a greater number of sexual partners. Further, experiencing social rejection was not related to the frequency of condom use. Implications for future research, prevention, and treatment are discussed.

AB  - Background: Both early life stress (ELS) and substance abuse, especially cocaine, have robust effects on the inflammatory system. Considering the role of the tumor necrosis factor system in inflammatory signaling and its association with ELS, the aim of the study was to compare plasma levels of TNF-alpha, its soluble receptors and ligands during early abstinence of crack cocaine. Methods: This study included 24 crack cocaine-dependent women with (CRACK-ELS) and 20 without (CRACK) a history of ELS. A healthy control group (HC), containing 25 participants, was included to provide reference values. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) retrospectively assessed childhood maltreatment history of patients. Plasma levels of TNF-alpha, TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), soluble receptors TNFRI (sTNFRI) and TNFRII (sTNFRII) were assessed on the 18th day of treatment. Results: The CRACK-ELS group had higher TNF-alpha and lower TWEAK levels compared to the CRACK and HC groups. sTNFRII was increased, but only in comparison with the crack cocaine group and the controls. TRAIL levels were slightly higher in the CRACK-ELS group, while no differences were found for sTNFRI levels. Also, TNF-alpha plasma level was positively predicted by abstinence severity and childhood maltreatment severity, and TWEAK was negatively predicted by childhood maltreatment severity. Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate the newly secreted tumor necrosis factor superfamily ligands, TWEAK and TRAIL, during crack cocaine abstinence, supporting the association between early life stress and peripheral pro-inflammatory levels.

AB  - Background: Neurotrophic factors have been investigated in the pathophysiology of alcohol and drug dependence and have been related to early life stress driving developmental programming of neuroendocrine systems. Methods: We conducted a follow-up study that aimed to assess the plasma levels of glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT4/5) in crack users during 3 weeks of early abstinence in comparison with healthy controls. We performed a comprehensive clinical assessment in female inpatients with crack cocaine dependence (separated into 2 groups: participants with (CSA+) and without (CSA–) a history of childhood sexual abuse) and a group of nonuser control participants. Results: Our sample included 104 women with crack cocaine dependence and 22 controls; of the women who used crack cocaine, 22 had a history of childhood sexual abuse and 82 did not. The GDNF plasma levels in the CSA+ group increased dramatically during 3 weeks of detoxification. In contrast, those in the CSA– group showed lower and stable levels of GDNF under the same conditions. Compared with the control group, BDNF plasma levels remained elevated and NGF levels were reduced during early abstinence. We found no differences in NT3 and NT4/5 between the patients and controls. However, within-group analyses showed that the CSA+ group exhibited higher levels of NT4/5 than the CSA– group at the end of detoxification. Limitations: Some of the participants were using neuroleptics, mood stabilizers or antidepressants; our sample included only women; memory bias could not be controlled; and we did not investigate the possible confounding effects of other forms of stress during childhood. Conclusion: This study supports the association between early life stress and peripheral neurotrophic factor levels in crack cocaine users. During early abstinence, plasmastic GDNF and NT4/5 were the only factors to show changes associated with a history of childhood sexual abuse.

AB  - Rationale: Cocaine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), and para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) disrupt normal thermoregulation in humans, with PMA being associated with more severe cases of hyperthermia. Harm minimization advice on how to prevent overheating depends on appropriate thermoregulatory behavior by drug users. Objectives: The purpose of the current study was to establish dose-response relationships for the effects of a number of commonly used illicit stimulants and investigate the behavioral response to increased core temperature. Materials and methods: Sprague-Dawley rats with telemetry implants were administered either saline or 4, 12, 26, 40 or 80 μmol/kg of cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, or PMA and confined to an ambient temperature of 30°C for 30 min, before being able to choose their preferred temperature on a thermally graded runway (11-41°C). Results: The increased core temperature caused by administration of cocaine, methamphetamine, and MDMA treatment led to the animals seeking the cool end of the runway to correct their core temperature, although this did not occur in PMA-treated rats. The order of potency for increasing core temperature was methamphetamine >PMA = MDMA > cocaine. This differed to the slopes of the dose-response curves where MDMA and PMA showed the steepest slope for the doses used followed by methamphetamine then cocaine. Conclusions: These results suggest that behavioral aspects of thermoregulation are important in assessing the potential of individual drugs to cause harmful increases in core temperature.

AB  - This paper examines the use of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) among a sample of gay men in New York City, who identify GHB as their most frequently used club drug. The sample was drawn from a larger longitudinal investigation of club drug using men. Thematic analysis yielded findings regarding perceived stigma for GHB use, tolerance of potential adverse side effects, and reasons for why some prefer this substance to other club drugs. Specifically, our findings suggest that GHB is viewed unfavorably in many social circles, that side effects are tolerated by frequent GHB users, and that the drug is chosen over other substances because of the short duration of action, energy boost, sleep assistance, increase in libido, and limited after-effects. Examining the reasons why men use this substance will lead to the development of GHB specific prevention strategies, which accurately address the consequences of use as well as the motivations that individuals possess for using the substance.

AB  - Objective: The completion of the human genome sequence has spurred investigation of the genetic contribution to substance dependence. In this article some of the recent scientific evidence for genetic determinants of opioid and cocaine dependence is reviewed. Method: An electronic search of the medical literature was conducted to locate published studies relevant to the genetics of opioid and cocaine dependence. The collected information judged to be most pertinent is described and discussed. Results: Genetic epidemiologic studies support a high degree of heritable vulnerability for both opioid and cocaine dependence. Polymorphisms in the genes coding for dopamine receptors and transporter, opioid receptors, endogenous opioid peptides, cannabinoid receptors, and serotonin receptors and transporter all appear to be associated with the phenotypic expression of this vulnerability once opioids or cocaine are consumed. Conclusions: Despite this initial progress, identification of specific genes and quantification of associated risk for the expression of each gene remain to be elucidated. While alteration of an individual's genome to change the phenotype seems remote, future interventions for treatment of opioid and cocaine dependence may include precise medications targeted to block the effects of proteins that have been identified through genetic research.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Individual and peer factors associated with ketamine use among adolescents in Taiwan' by Kun-Hua Lee, Yi-Chun Yeh, Pin-Chen Yang, Huang-Chi Lin, Peng-Wei Wang, Tai-Ling Liu and Cheng-Fang Yen (European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 2012[Oct], Vol 21[10], 553-558). In the original publication, the scoring method of the Negative outcome expectancy for ketamine is incorrectly described. The correct version is presented in erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2012-27989-003[/rid]). The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the individual (demographic characteristics, substance-using behaviors, emotional status, and negative outcome expectancy) and peer factors associated with ketamine use in Taiwanese adolescents. A total of 9,860 adolescents completed the self-report questionnaires without omission. Demographic characteristics, substance-using behaviors, emotional status, negative outcome expectancy, and peer factors were compared between the ketamine users and non-users using the Mann–Whitney U test and the Chi-square test, and then significant factors were further selected for stepwise logistic regression analysis to examine the associated factors of ketamine use. Sixty-nine (0.7 %) participants reported having used ketamine in the past year. The results of logistic regression analysis indicated that ketamine users were more likely to use marijuana, smoke cigarettes, have peers using illicit drugs, and have a lower level of negative outcome expectancy regarding using ketamine than ketamine non-users. The associated factors found in this study should be taken into consideration when developing prevention and intervention programs for ketamine use in adolescents.

AB  - Examined the effects of the neurotoxin methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on neuronal activity and cell signaling mediated through adenylyl cyclase (AC) in young and aged male mice. Ss were injected with MDMA; 1 wk subsequently, AC activity and dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels were examined in the caudate, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus. Results show that young Ss showed 80% depletion of dopamine in the caudate and 30% depletion in the cerebral cortex. There was a compensatory upregulation of dopamine turnover activity of the remaining neurons in the caudate but downregulation in the cerebral cortex. Serotonin levels were less affected but turnover decreased significantly in both regions. Young Ss showed heterologous upregulation of AC activity. In aged Ss, MDMA treatment produced the same degree of lesioning in the cerebral cortex but increased dopamine and serotonin turnover, effects opposite to those seen in young Ss. In aged Ss, MDMA elicited heterologous loss of AC responses instead of displaying the supersensitivity that had been seen in young Ss. Findings suggest that the aging mouse brain displays maladaptation to the loss of monoaminergic input, which may augment functional impairment associated with neurodegenerative disorders or stroke.

AB  - African Americans continue to struggle against racist oppression, creating undue and excess psychologic stress. As is stated in the Culture, Race, Ethnicity Supplement to the 1999 Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health: 'The African American experience in the U.S. is rife with episodes of subjugation and displacement... The legacy of slavery and discrimination continues to influence their (African American) social and economic standing. This study of crack cocaine addicted men in New Orleans taught many valuable lessons and suggests a preventive strategy applicable to any emerging culture in the diaspora. Our real challenge as mental health professionals is to bridge the gap between our understanding of the historical, socio-political, and real life experiences of discrimination and racism and the psychologic impact of these experiences; to raise our voices; and to develop better integrated, more effective therapeutic interventions for African Americans. This study of crack cocaine addicted men in New Orleans taught many valuable lessons and suggests a preventive strategy applicable to any emerging culture in the diaspora. Two case examples are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rationale: Drug abuse can be characterized as a condition in which the choice to self-administer a drug is excessive, even exclusive of the choice of other reinforcers. Under concurrent interval schedules of reinforcement, subjects typically distribute behavior to match reinforcement allocation. However, research has shown that when behavior is maintained by different doses of cocaine under concurrent variable-interval (cone VI) schedules, exclusive choice of the higher dose is the rule. Objective: The present study was designed to examine the generality of this finding to other behavioral conditions. Methods: Rhesus monkeys (n=5) lever pressed under a cone VI 60-s VI 60-s or a cone VI 600- s VI 600-s schedule of cocaine (i.v.) presentation. Doses differing by 4-fold (0.025 versus 0.1, 0.05 versus 0.2 mg/kg per injection) were available for lever pressing. Results: Monkeys responded more on the lever associated with the higher dose when saline or a lower dose was the alternative. The distribution of responses was well predicted by relative drug intake, but with consistent under-matching. Exclusive high-dose responding was seen in about half of the individual session intervals under the shorter schedule, rarely under the longer schedule, and was not seen over the session. Conclusion: Under cone VI schedules, behavior was apportioned between two different doses in a manner that favored the higher dose but undermatched relative intake. Exclusive high-dose choice may occur when cocaine is frequently available but is not an invariable outcome of the choice between a low and a high dose of cocaine.

AB  - Ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but the magnitude of response varies considerably between individual patients. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been investigated as a biomarker of treatment response in depression and has been implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. We evaluated plasma BDNF and associations with symptoms in 22 patients with TRD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of ketamine compared to an anaesthetic control (midazolam). Ketamine significantly increased plasma BDNF levels in responders compared to non-responders 240 min post-infusion, and Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores were negatively correlated with BDNF (r = −0.701, p = 0.008). Plasma BDNF levels at 240 min post-infusion were highly negatively associated with MADRS scores at 240 min (r = −0.897, p = .002), 24 h (r = −0.791, p = 0.038), 48 h (r = −0.944, p = 0.001) and 72 h (r = −0.977, p = 0.010). No associations with BDNF were found for patients receiving midazolam. These data support plasma BDNF as a peripheral biomarker relevant to ketamine antidepressant response.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of single ketamine infusion and clinical and biochemical factors connected with such efficacy, in patients with bipolar depression, which had not improved on antidepressant treatment. Methods: The study included 42 patients (32 women, 10 men), aged 22-67 years, with bipolar depression. They received ≥1 mood-stabilizing medications of first and/or second generation. After discontinuation of antidepressants (≥7 days), intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5mg/kg body weight) was performed. The assessment of depression by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was made before, and after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days following administration of ketamine. The assumed criterion for clinical improvement was the reduction of ≥50% score on the Hamilton scale after 7 days. In a subgroup of 20 patients, prior to administration of ketamine, serum concentrations of homocysteine, vitamin B12, folic acid, neurotrophins and inflammatory proteins were measured. Results: In the whole group, the severity of depression on the Hamilton scale decreased significantly 24 hours after administration of ketamine from 22.6 ± 5.1 to 15.6 ± 7.4 points. After 7 days it was 13 ± 7 and after 14 days—11.8 ± 7.8 points. Patients showing clinical improvement (n = 22) had significantly higher frequency of alcohol addiction and family history of alcoholism. Biochemical tests in the subset of 20 patients demonstrated that those with clinical improvement (n = 10) had higher serum concentrations of vitamin B12 and receptor-1 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor before administration of ketamine. Ketamine infusion was well tolerated. Conclusions: The results confirm a rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine infusion maintaining for 2 weeks, in a considerable proportion of patients with bipolar depression, and good clinical tolerance of such procedure. Also, some clinical and biochemical factors associated with ketamine efficacy were shown. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Applied the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to examine the psychosocial determinants of ecstasy use in young people in the UK. In Study 1, 186 19–25 yr old students completed questionnaires measuring components of the TPB. In Study 2, 203 18–38 yr old members of a nightclub completed measures of attitudinal ambivalence and components of the TPB in relation to taking ecstasy in the next 2 mo (n = 123 respondents). Reported use of ecstasy was assessed 2 mo later. In Study 1, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control accounted for 50% of the variance in intentions. In Study 2, TPB components explained 63% of the variance in intentions. Intentions and perceived control explained 55% of the variance in subsequent ecstasy use. Attitudinal ambivalence moderated the intention-behavior relationship such that the impact of intentions on subsequent behavior was significantly stronger for individuals with lower levels of ambivalence. The TPB provided a good basis for understanding intentions and actual use of ecstasy in young people in the UK. The different beliefs of users and non-users may form a useful basis for health education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Major depressive disorder is a devastating mental disorder. Current antidepressant medications can be effective for some patients with depression; however, these drugs exert mood-elevating effects only after prolonged administration, and a sizable fraction of the patient population fails to respond to treatment. There is an urgent need for faster-acting antidepressants with reliable treatment outcomes and sustained efficacy for individuals with depression, in particular those contemplating suicide. Recent clinical studies report that ketamine, an ionotropic glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, shows fast-acting antidepressant action, thus bringing fresh perspective into preclinical studies investigating novel antidepressant targets and treatments. Our recent studies show that the effects of ketamine are dependent on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and subsequent activation of the high-affinity BDNF receptor, TrkB. Our findings also suggest that the fast-acting antidepressant effects of ketamine require rapid protein translation, but not transcription, resulting in robust increases in dendritic BDNF protein levels that are important for the behavioral effect. These findings also uncover eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), a Ca2+ /calmodulin dependent serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates eEF2 and regulates the elongation step of protein translation, as a major molecular substrate mediating the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine. Our results show that ketamine-mediated suppression of resting NMDA receptor activity leads to inhibition of eEF2 kinase and subsequent dephosphorylation of eEF2 and augmentation of BDNF synthesis. This article outlines our recent studies on the synaptic mechanisms that underlie ketamine action, in particular the properties of eEF2K as a potential antidepressant target.

AB  - Examined the reinforcing effects of oral cocaine to determine whether such effects can be influenced by manipulating behavioral requirements following drug ingestion. Nine adult volunteers with histories of cocaine abuse were trained to discriminate between orally administered cocaine (100 mg/70 kg) and placebo under double-blind conditions. Following acquisition of cocaine vs placebo discrimination, the reinforcing effects of cocaine were determined using dependent and independent choice activities. Ss were first exposed to cocaine or placebo once each with a vigilance and a relaxation activity. In the dependent choice condition, all Ss significantly chose cocaine over placebo with the vigilance activity and chose placebo over cocaine with the relaxation activity. In the independent choice condition, Ss significantly chose cocaine over placebo in the vigilance activity (i.e., cocaine functioned as a positive reinforcer in this context). The results show that the behavioral requirements following drug ingestion can be a determinant of whether or not oral cocaine functions as a reinforcer in this population.

AB  - Presents findings from an elicitation study that focused on the sexual risks and condom use behavior of African American crack smokers. Of interest were the attitudes, beliefs, and barriers that affect the adoption and maintenance of condoms as an HIV prophylactic. Descriptive data were collected from 64 heterosexual African Americans (aged 19–53 yrs) who smoke crack cocaine. Data were content analyzed for descriptions of condom use attitudes, normative beliefs, and barriers or facilitators of condom use. Participants described few positive condom use outcome expectations, while detailing several negative expectations. Normative beliefs were found to be weakly related to condom use with casual partners. However, descriptions of sexual relationships with intimate partners indicated that the normative expectations of the partner strongly influenced condom use. Participants described few contextual barriers to condom use, although situational barriers, including crack addiction, were identified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Here we explored the in vivo role of brain corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type-2 (CRFR2) in cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug seeking. Conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure was used to assess the acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior in rats. First, expressions of CRFR2 were shown to be affected in a brain region-specific manner within cocaine-induced CPP and cocaine-extinct CPP models. Bilateral blockade of CRFR2 in the dorsal portion of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), or hippocampus (HP) was partially inhibited, but in the dorsal striatum (DS) did not affect, the cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine CPP.

AB  - Animal models have provided valuable information about pharmacological and environmental factors that precipitate reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking in rats and monkeys, as well as new insights about potential pharmacotherapies for relapse prevention. Reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior in animals can be induced by cocaine priming or by cocaine-paired environmental stimuli; however, maximum reinstatement of drug-seeking appears to be induced when cocaine priming and cocaine-paired stimuli are combined. Drugs that share cocaine's indirect dopamine agonist properties or that act as direct agonists at D₂-like dopamme receptors also induce reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, whereas with some exceptions (e.g., caffeine, morphine) drugs from other pharmacological classes do not. D₁-like receptor agonists block rather than mimic the priming effects of cocaine, suggesting different roles for D₁- and D₂-like receptor mechanisms in cocaine relapse. Recent findings with D₁-like receptor agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists suggest that some of these drugs may be viable candidates for development as antirelapse pharmacotherapies.

AB  - Summarizes and critiques the preclinical findings on environmental determinants of cocaine self administration (CSA). The influence of environmental variables on the effects of pharmacological interventions on CSA are also described. Several environmental variables have been shown to affect CSA, including unit dose, schedule of cocaine delivery (SCD), schedules of nondrug stimuli, behavioral history, conditioned stimuli, food deprivation (FD), exposure to stress, and rearing environment (RE). Among these variables, unit dose, SCD, availability of alternative nondrug reinforcers, FD, and RE have also been shown to alter pharmacological treatment effects on CSA. Thus, drug effects on CSA are malleable and dependent upon the environmental context within which they occur. Suggestions for future research on the effects of these and other environmental variables on CSA and its pharmacological treatment are presented.

AB  - Many studies have reported a withdrawal-dependent increase in synaptic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of cocaine-sensitized rats; however, the exact relationship between the expression of sensitization and altered AMPAR surface expression in the NAc has not yet been investigated. We demonstrated that the expression of behavioral sensitization was negatively controlled by N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF)-GluR2 interactions in the NAc. The upregulation of NSF–GluR2 interactions, which may be resulted by the increase in NSF S-nitrosylation after withdrawal from cocaine, was associated with the changes in the expression of behavioral sensitization. Disruption of NSF–GluR2 interactions in the NAc with a specific peptide, TAT-pep-R845A, increased the locomotor response of rats to cocaine by decreasing GluR2 surface insertion. In contrast, prevention of GluR2-containing AMPARs removal from synapses with Pep2-EVKI attenuated the expression of behavioral sensitization. Similarly, treatment with the nitric oxide donor, S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP), attenuated the expression of locomotor sensitization by promoting GluR2 surface expression. This effect was mediated by the binding of S-nitrosylated NSF to GluR2, which promoted the surface expression of AMPARs. Noticeably, exogenous injection of SNAP into NAc also attenuated the expression of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference. Thus, these results indicate that increased NSF–GluR2 interactions in the NAc after withdrawal from cocaine attenuated the expression of behavioral sensitization and serves as a negative regulatory mechanism in drug-exposed individuals.

AB  - Factors that contributed to long-term recovery from cocaine dependence were examined as part of a 5-year national follow-up study of 708 patients (mean age 33 years) from 45 treatment programs in eight U.S. cities. Outcomes from 33% of the sample were highly favorable at follow-up, including no drugs detected in urine or hair specimens, no self-reported use of any drugs, less than daily alcohol use, and no illegal activity or arrests during the past year. Major reasons cited for these improvements were motivations to change, positive influences of family, strength from religion and spirituality, and help from drug treatment. 'Recovery' was viewed as a continuous process and one that benefits from lessons learned in treatment. These retrospective attributions affirm many of the same findings from prospective outcome studies and contribute to a conceptual framework for treatment process and recovery.

AB  - Background: A number of demographic factors, psychiatric disorders, and childhood risk factors have been associated with cocaine dependence (CD) and opioid dependence (OD), but little is known about their relevance to the rate at which dependence develops. Identification of the subpopulations at elevated risk for rapid development of dependence and the risk factors that accelerate the course of dependence is an important public health goal. Methods: Data were derived from cocaine dependent (n = 6333) and opioid dependent (n = 3513) participants in a multi-site study of substance dependence. Mean age was approximately 40 and 40% of participants were women; 51.9% of cocaine dependent participants and 29.5% of opioid dependent participants self-identified as Black/African–American. The time from first use to dependence was calculated for each substance and a range of demographic, psychiatric, and childhood risk factors were entered into ordinal logistic regression models to predict the (categorical) transition time to CD and OD. Results: In both the cocaine and opioid models, conduct disorder and childhood physical abuse predicted rapid development of dependence and alcohol and nicotine dependence diagnoses were associated with slower progression to CD or OD. Blacks/African Americans were at greater risk than European Americans to progress rapidly to OD. Conclusions: Only a subset of factors known to be associated with CD and OD predicted the rate at which dependence developed. Nearly all were common to cocaine and opioids, suggesting that sources of influence on the timing of transitions to dependence are shared across the two substances.

AB  - We assessed mortality risk factors and excess mortality compared to the general population in two Spanish sub-cohorts of 8,825 cocaine and heroin users (CHUs) and 11,905 only cocaine users (OCUs) aged 15–49 admitted to drug treatment. Heroin use (among all cocaine users), no-regular employment and drug injection (among CHUs and OCUs), daily cocaine use and previous drug treatment (among CUs), and death before 2005 and > 10 years of heroin use (among CHUs) were clearly associated with higher mortality in Cox regression. Excess mortality was assessed by the directly standardized mortality rate ratio, which was higher in CHUs (14.3; 95% CI: 12.6–16.2) than CUs (5.1; 95% CI: 4.3–6.0) and in women than men, especially among OCUs (8.6; 95% CI: 7.5–10.0 vs. 3.5; 95% CI: 3.3–3.8); it decreased with age among CHUs, but did not decrease overall during 1997–2008. OCUs excess mortality was considerable and showed no signs of decline, suggesting the need for improved treatment and prevention interventions.

AB  - Intermittent social defeat stress induces cross-sensitization to psychostimulants and escalation of drug self-administration. These behaviors could result from the stress-induced neuroadaptation in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine circuit. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is persistently elevated after social defeat stress, and may contribute to the stress-induced neuroadaptation in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine circuit. BDNF modulates synaptic plasticity, and facilitates stress- and drug-induced neuroadaptations in the mesocorticolimbic system. The present research examined the role of mesolimbic BDNF signaling in social defeat stress-induced cross-sensitization to psychostimulants and the escalation of cocaine self-administration in rats. We measured drug taking behavior with the acquisition, progressive ratio, and binge paradigms during self-administration. With BDNF overexpression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), single social defeat stress-induced cross-sensitization to amphetamine (AMPH) was significantly potentiated. VTA-BDNF overexpression also facilitates acquisition of cocaine self-administration, and a positive correlation between the level of VTA BDNF and drug intake during 12 hour binge was observed. We also found significant increase of DeltaFosB expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the projection area of the VTA, in rats received intra-VTA BDNF overexpression. We therefore examined whether BDNF signaling in the NAc is important for social defeat stress-induced cross-sensitization by knockdown of the receptor of BDNF (neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptor type 2, TrkB) there. NAc TrkB knockdown prevented social defeat stress-induced cross-sensitization to psychostimulant. Also social defeat stress-induced increase of DeltaFosB in the NAc was prevented by TrkB knockdown. Several other factors up-regulated by stress, such as the GluA1 subunit of Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor and BDNF in the VTA were also prevented. We conclude that BDNF signaling in the VTA increases social defeat stress-induced vulnerability to psychostimulants, manifested as potentiated cross-sensitization/sensitization to AMPH and escalation of cocaine self-administration. Also BDNF signaling in the NAc is necessary for the stress-induced neuroadaptation and behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants. Therefore, TrkB in the NAc could be a therapeutic target to prevent stress-induced vulnerability to drugs of abuse in the future. DeltaFosB in the NAc shell could be a neural substrate underlying persistent cross-sensitization and augmented cocaine self-administration induced by social defeat stress.

AB  - The neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), plays a critical role in the central regulation of various stress-related behaviours, including those unique to subjects with prior cocaine experience. The three series of experiments presented in this dissertation explored the role of two neurochemical systems, the teneurin C-terminal associated peptides (TCAP) and the endocannabinoids (eCBs), in several cocaine- and anxiety-related behaviours induced or mediated by CRF. The first series of experiments examined the effects of TCAP-1 on the reinstatement of cocaine seeking and expression of cocaine-induced behavioural sensitization. Repeated (5-day), but not acute, TCAP-1 treatment blocked the reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by central injections of CRF. TCAP-1 was, however, without effect on footshock- or cocaine-induced reinstatement. Repeated TCAP-1 further interfered with the expression of behavioural sensitization to a CRF, but not a cocaine, challenge. These findings suggest that TCAP-1 normalizes CRF signaling dysregulated by cocaine exposure to interfere in the subsequent effects of CRF on cocaine-related behaviours. A parallel series of experiments investigated the role of eCB signaling at CB1 receptors in the reinstatement of cocaine seeking and cocaine-sensitized locomotion. Pretreatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist, AM251, selectively interfered with CRF-, but not footshock- or cocaine-induced reinstatement. AM251 further blocked the expression of behavioural sensitization induced by challenge injections of both CRF and cocaine. These findings reveal a mediating role for CB1 receptor transmission in the effects of CRF on cocaine-related behaviours. A final series of experiments examined the role of CB1 receptor transmission in the behavioural anxiety induced by central injections of CRF, and by withdrawal from chronic cocaine exposure. AM251, although itself anxiogenic, reversed anxiety induced by CRF and cocaine withdrawal. Furthermore, AM251 elevated plasma corticosterone levels, indicative of increased HPA axis activity, irrespective of CRF treatment or cocaine withdrawal. These findings suggest that CRF- and cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety are mediated, at least in part, by CB1 receptor transmission, independent of HPA axis regulation. The collective findings are discussed within a framework of CRF-TCAP-eCB interactions, wherein TCAP-1 and AM251 are proposed to act in parallel to modulate amygdalar CRF transmission, and thus regulate the expression of cocaine- and anxiety-related behaviours.

AB  - It has been well established that the stress-related neurochemical systems corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), noradrenaline (NA), and dopamine (DA) mediate stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. The three series of experiments presented in this dissertation constitute a further exploration of the role these neurochemical circuits play in reinstatement by providing the first direct exploration of whether central CRF and catecholamine (NA and DA) systems interact to influence reinstatement of cocaine seeking. The primary objective of the first series of experiments was to determine whether NA and CRF systems interact to mediate reinstatement of cocaine seeking and, if so, to determine the direction of this interaction. Results showed that central administration of NA induced reinstatement and up-regulated the expression of c-fos mRNA, a marker of neuronal activation, in brain regions involved in footshock-induced reinstatement. Pretreatment with a CRF antagonist blocked NA-induced reinstatement. In contrast, pretreatment with the α2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, failed to block CRF-induced reinstatement. Taken together, these findings suggest a functional interaction between NA and CRF systems in mediating stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, whereby activation of CRF receptors occurs subsequent to, and downstream of, the sites of action of NA. A second series of experiments examined the role of D1- and D2-like receptors in CRF-induced reinstatement. Pretreatment with the D1- or D2-like receptor antagonists, SCH23390 and raclopride, respectively, dose-dependently blocked CRF-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Taken together with previous findings, these results suggest that CRF-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking likely involves DAergic signaling via D1- and D2-like receptors, subsequent to activation of CRF receptors. The final series of experiments investigated the neuropharmacology of yohimbine-induced reinstatement, focusing on the roles of α2-adrenoceptors, D1- and D2-like receptors. These experiments were prompted by an unexpected finding in the first series of experiments, in which a CRF antagonist failed to interfere in yohimbine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Results showed that pretreatment with the α2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, or raclopride, prior to tests for yohimbine-induced reinstatement failed to influence responding. In contrast, pretreatment with SCH23390 blocked yohimbine-induced reinstatement. Taken together, these findings suggest that yohimbine may act through system(s) other than NA to have its effects.

AB  - Recent reports suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could be a biomarker for relapse, drug craving and withdrawal severity. In particular, elevated BDNF levels among former cocaine users have been associated with higher rates of relapse in 90 d. However, no data are available on BDNF levels at baseline and during crack cocaine withdrawal. This study evaluated BDNF among crack cocaine users during inpatient treatment, before and after withdrawal, vs. healthy controls. Clinical correlates with changes in BDNF levels were also assessed. Serum BDNF was evaluated in 49 male crack users on the first and last days of hospitalization and in 97 healthy controls. Serum BDNF was assayed using a sandwich ELISA kit. BDNF levels were significantly lower upon admission when compared to controls, even after adjustment for age, length of inpatient treatment, number of crack rocks used in the last 30 d, years of crack use and interaction between the latter two variables. At discharge, BDNF levels between patients and controls were similar. Number of crack rocks used in the last 30 d and years of crack use were inversely correlated with the outcome. Our findings show that BDNF levels increase during early crack cocaine withdrawal, at an inverse correlation with number of crack rocks used in the last 30 d and years of crack use.

AB  - Used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the computerized MicroCog Assessment of Cognitive Functioning (D. H. Powell et al, 1993) to examine the association between intracranial volume (premorbid brain size) and neuropsychological function in 19 abstinent crack-cocaine and 28 crack-cocaine-alcohol dependent individuals. There were no significant differences between the crack-only and the crack-alcohol dependent Ss in neuropsychological performance or in intracranial volume. Abstinent cocaine-dependent Ss (both crack-only and crack-alcohol) were significantly impaired in many neuropsychological domains. Intracranial volume accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in neuropsychological performance. This result is consistent with the finding in the Alzheimer's literature that larger brains can maintain function to a greater degree, or for a longer period of time, in the face of cerebral disease or insult. Functional reserve may be a heretofore little recognized protective mechanism of the brain that has consequences for the severity of expression of cerebral disease or insult throughout life.

AB  - Background: Cocaine-induced psychosis (CIP) is among the most serious adverse effects of cocaine. Reduced serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels have been reported in schizophrenia and psychosis; however, studies assessing the involvement of BDNF in CIP are lacking. Methods: A total of 22 cocaine-dependent patients (aged 33.65 ± 6.85) who had never experienced psychotic symptoms under the influence of cocaine (non-CIP) and 18 patients (aged 34.18 ± 8.54) with a history of CIP completed a 2-week detoxification program in an inpatient facility. Two serum samples were collected from each patient at baseline and at the end of the protocol. Demographic, consumption and clinical data were recorded for all patients. A paired group of healthy controls was also included. Results: At the beginning of the detoxification treatment, serum BDNF levels were similar in both the non-CIP and the CIP groups. During early abstinence, the non-CIP group exhibited a significant increase in serum BDNF levels (p = 0.030), whereas the CIP group exhibited a decrease. Improvements in depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI, p = 0.003) and withdrawal symptoms (Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment, CSSA, p = 0.013) show a significant positive correlation with serum BDNF levels in the non-CIP group, whereas no correlation between the same variables was found in the CIP group. Conclusions: This study suggests that BDNF plays a role in the transient psychotic symptoms associated with cocaine consumption. In the non-CIP group, the increase in serum BDNF appears to be driven by the effects of chronic cocaine consumption and withdrawal. In contrast, patients with CIP share some of the neurotrophic deficiencies that characterize schizophrenia and psychosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cocaine is a widely used drug and its abuse is associated with physical, psychiatric and social problems. Abnormalities in newborns have been demonstrated to be due to the toxic effects of cocaine during fetal development. The mechanism by which cocaine causes neurological damage is complex and involves interactions of the drug with several neurotransmitter systems, such as the increase of extracellular levels of dopamine and free radicals, and modulation of transcription factors. The aim of this review was to evaluate the importance of the dopaminergic system and the participation of inflammatory signaling in cocaine neurotoxicity. Our study showed that cocaine activates the transcription factors NF-κB and CREB, which regulate genes involved in cellular death. GBR 12909 (an inhibitor of dopamine reuptake), lidocaine (a local anesthetic), and dopamine did not activate NF-κB in the same way as cocaine. However, the attenuation of NF-κB activity after the pretreatment of the cells with SCH 23390, a D1 receptor antagonist, suggests that the activation of NF-κB by cocaine is, at least partially, due to activation of D1 receptors. NF-κB seems to have a protective role in these cells because its inhibition increased cellular death caused by cocaine. The increase in BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) mRNA can also be related to the protective role of both CREB and NF-κB transcription factors. An understanding of the mechanisms by which cocaine induces cell death in the brain will contribute to the development of new therapies for drug abusers, which can help to slow down the progress of degenerative processes.

AB  - Genetic factors significantly influence addiction-related phenotypes. This is supported by the successful bidirectional selective breeding of two replicate sets of mouse lines for amount of methamphetamine consumed. Some of the same genetic factors that influence methamphetamine consumption have been previously found also to influence sensitivity to the conditioned rewarding and aversive effects of methamphetamine. The goal of the current studies was to determine if some of the same genetic factors influence sensitivity to the conditioned rewarding and aversive effects of cocaine. Cocaine conditioned reward was examined in methamphetamine high drinking and low drinking line mice using a conditioned place preference procedure and cocaine conditioned aversion was measured using a conditioned taste aversion procedure. In addition, a general sensitivity measure, locomotor stimulant response to cocaine, was assessed in these lines; previous data indicated no difference between the selected lines in sensitivity to methamphetamine-induced stimulation. In contrast to robust differences for methamphetamine, the methamphetamine high and low drinking lines did not differ in sensitivity to either the rewarding or aversive effects of cocaine. They also exhibited comparable sensitivity to cocaine-induced locomotor stimulation. These data suggest that the genetic factors that influence sensitivity to the conditioned rewarding and aversive effects of methamphetamine in these lines of mice do not influence sensitivity to these effects of cocaine. Thus, different genetic factors may influence risk for methamphetamine versus cocaine use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cue-induced cocaine craving intensifies, or ‘incubates’, during the first few weeks of abstinence and persists over extended periods of time. One important factor implicated in cocaine addiction is the endogenous opioid β-endorphin. In the present study, we examined the possible involvement of β-endorphin in the incubation of cocaine craving. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.75 mg/kg, 10 days, 6 h/day), followed by either a 1-day or a 30-day period of forced abstinence. Subsequent testing for cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior (without cocaine reinforcement) was performed. Rats exposed to the drug-associated cue on day 1 of forced abstinence demonstrated minimal cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior concurrently with a significant increase in β-endorphin release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Conversely, exposure to the cue on day 30 increased cocaine seeking, while β-endorphin levels remained unchanged. Intra-NAc infusion of an anti-β-endorphin antibody (4 μg) on day 1 increased cue-induced cocaine seeking, whereas infusion of a synthetic β-endorphin peptide (100 ng) on day 30 significantly decreased cue response. Both intra-NAc infusions of the δ opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole (1 μg) on day 1 and naltrindole together with β-endorphin on day 30 increased cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior. Intra-NAc infusion of the μ opioid receptor antagonist CTAP (30 ng and 3 μg) had no behavioral effect. Altogether, these results demonstrate a novel role for β-endorphin and the δ opioid receptor in the development of the incubation of cocaine craving.

AB  - Preclinical studies indicate that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in neuroplastic changes underlying enduring cocaine-seeking following withdrawal. However, little is known about temporal changes in serum BDNF levels or the involvement of BDNF in craving and abstinence in early-abstinent cocaine-dependent patients. Twenty-three cocaine-dependent individuals (aged 33.65 ± 6.85 years) completed a two-week detoxification program at an inpatient facility. Two serum samples were collected for each patient at baseline and at the end of the protocol. Serum samples were also collected for 46 healthy controls (aged 35.52 ± 9.37 years). Demographic, consumption and clinical data were recorded for all patients. Significantly lower serum BDNF levels (p < .0001) were observed for cocaine-dependent patients at baseline compared to healthy controls. Serum BDNF levels increased significantly across 12 days of early abstinence (p = .030). Baseline BDNF levels correlated with craving (p = .034). Post-detoxification BDNF levels correlated with craving (p = .018), loss of control (p < .000), abstinence measures (p = 0.031), depression (p = 0.036), and anxiety (p = 0.036). Post-detoxification BDNF levels also had predictive value for the loss of control measure of craving. Chronic cocaine use is associated with decreased serum BDNF. A progressive increase in serum BDNF levels during early abstinence correlates with cocaine craving and abstinence symptoms and may reflect increasing BDNF levels in different brain regions. These findings suggest that serum BDNF may be a biomarker for cocaine addiction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The goal was to identify factors that predicted sustained cocaine abstinence and transitions from cocaine use to abstinence over 24 months. Data from baseline assessments and multiple follow-ups were obtained from three studies of continuing care for patients in intensive outpatient programs (IOPs). In the combined sample, remaining cocaine abstinent and transitioning into abstinence at the next follow-up were predicted by older age, less education, and less cocaine and alcohol use at baseline, and by higher self-efficacy, commitment to abstinence, better social support, lower depression, and lower scores on other problem severity measures assessed during the follow-up. In addition, higher self-help participation, self-help beliefs, readiness to change, and coping assessed during the follow-up predicted transitions from cocaine use to abstinence. These results were stable over 24 months. Commitment to abstinence, self-help behaviors and beliefs, and self-efficacy contributed independently to the prediction of cocaine use transitions. Implications for treatment are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - An understanding of the complex interaction between cocaine and environmental factors is essential for the development of successful approaches for prevention and treatment of cocaine abuse. This chapter examines issues regarding cocaine reinforcement. First, the influence of reinforcement schedules and schedules currently used for evaluating cocaine's reinforcing effectiveness are evaluated. Next, specific environmental conditions affecting cocaine reinforcement are presented, with special attention to dose and access conditions. The authors then consider environmental contexts, such as drug history, alternative reinforcing events, and stress. Finally, regulatory processes that may affect the evaluation of cocaine reinforcement, such as direct stimulant or depressant effects vs satiation, are considered.

AB  - This chapter highlights the role of selected behavioral effects of cocaine and of contextual factors in experimental procedures to evaluate its abuse liability. Cocaine is a psychomotor stimulant, and a defining characteristic of this class of drugs is stimulation of either learned behavior or unlearned locomotor activity at doses below those producing convulsions. Accordingly, in the 1st section, we examine the contribution of cocaine's behavioral effects in the assessment of its abuse liability. In the 2nd section, we briefly consider the contemporary focus on motivational constructs as explanatory principles in understanding the abuse of cocaine and other drugs. Additionally, the contribution of such constructs to the assessment of abuse liability is briefly considered. Finally, cocaine's effectiveness in self-administration procedures have contributed to the perception that its abuse potential is unrivaled. In the final sections, we examine this notion by discussing how the effects of cocaine in self-administration procedures are modified by contextual factors, including the schedule of self-administration, availability of other reinforcing stimuli, and superimposition of schedules of punishment.

AB  - There is an abundance of evidence showing that repeated use of 3,4-methlylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is associated with brain dysfunction, memory disturbance, locomotor hyperactivity, and hyperthermia. MDMA is toxic to both the serotonergic neurons and dopaminergic system. Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside with a neuromodulatory function in the central nervous system. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) plays a pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of an immune response by triggering the expression of major inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Here, we investigated the effects of the A2a adenosine receptor (A2a-R) agonist (CGS) and antagonist (SCH) on NF-kB expression after MDMA administration. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were injected to MDMA (10 mg/kg) followed by intraperitoneal injection of either CGS or SCH (0.03 mg/kg each) to animals. The hippocampi were then removed for western blot and RT- PCR analyses. MDMA significantly elevated NF-kB expression. Our results show that administration of CGS following MDMA significantly elevated the NFkB expression both at mRNA and protein levels. By contrast, administration of the A2a-R antagonist SCH resulted in a decrease in the NF-kB levels. Taken together, these results indicate that, co-administration of A2a agonist (CGS) can protect against MDMA neurotoxic effects by increasing NFkB expression levels; suggesting a potential application for protection against the neurotoxic effects observed in MDMA users.

AB  - Ecstasy use may result in lowered mood, anxiety or aggression in the days following use. Yet, few studies have investigated what factors increase the risk of experiencing such symptoms. Ecstasy users (at least once in the last 12 months) who subsequently took ecstasy (n = 35) over the period of one week, were compared on measures of mood, sleep, stress and drug use, with those who abstained from ecstasy (n = 21) that week. Measures were administered the week prior to ecstasy use and one and three days following use, or the equivalent day for abstainers. Mood symptoms were assessed using the Kessler-10 self-report psychological distress scale, a subjective mood rating (1–10), and using the depression, anxiety and hostility items from the clinician-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Timeline Followback methods were used to collect information on drug use and life stress in the past month. Self-reported sleep quality was also assessed. Ecstasy use was not associated with subacute depressive, anxiety or aggressive symptoms. Rather, lowered mood and increased psychological distress were associated with self-reported hours and quality of sleep obtained during the three-day follow-up. These findings highlight the importance of considering sleep disruption in understanding the short-term mood effects of ecstasy use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 26(8) of European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (see record [rid]2017-32923-002[/rid]). In the original publication, the scoring method of the Negative outcome expectancy for ketamine is incorrectly described. The correct version is presented in erratum.] The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the individual (demographic characteristics, substance-using behaviors, emotional status, and negative outcome expectancy) and peer factors associated with ketamine use in Taiwanese adolescents. A total of 9,860 adolescents completed the self-report questionnaires without omission. Demographic characteristics, substance-using behaviors, emotional status, negative outcome expectancy, and peer factors were compared between the ketamine users and non-users using the Mann–Whitney U test and the Chi-square test, and then significant factors were further selected for stepwise logistic regression analysis to examine the associated factors of ketamine use. Sixty-nine (0.7 %) participants reported having used ketamine in the past year. The results of logistic regression analysis indicated that ketamine users were more likely to use marijuana, smoke cigarettes, have peers using illicit drugs, and have a lower level of negative outcome expectancy regarding using ketamine than ketamine non-users. The associated factors found in this study should be taken into consideration when developing prevention and intervention programs for ketamine use in adolescents.

AB  - Background: Knock-in mice with the common human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism have impaired trafficking of BDNF messenger RNA to dendrites. It was hypothesized, given evidence that local synapse formation is dependent on dendritic translation of BDNF messenger RNA, that loss-of-function Met allele mice would show synaptic deficits both at baseline and in response to ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that stimulates synaptogenesis in prefrontal cortex (PFC). Methods: Whole-cell recordings from layer V medial PFC pyramidal cells in brain slices were combined with two-photon laser scanning for analysis of wildtype, Val/Met, and Met/Met mice both at baseline and in response to a low dose of ketamine. Results: Val/Met and Met/Met mice were found to have constitutive atrophy of distal apical dendrites and decrements in apically targeted excitatory postsynaptic currents in layer V pyramidal cells of PFC. In addition, spine density and diameter were decreased, indicative of impaired synaptic formation/maturation (synaptogenesis). In Met/Met mice the synaptogenic effect of ketamine was markedly impaired, consistent with the idea that synaptogenesis is dependent on dendritic translation/release of BDNF. In parallel behavioral studies, we found that the antidepressant response to ketamine in the forced swim test was blocked in Met/Met mice. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that expression of the BDNF Met allele in mice results in basal synaptic deficits and blocks synaptogenic and antidepressant actions of ketamine in PFC, suggesting that the therapeutic response to this drug might be attenuated or blocked in depressed patients who carry the loss of function Met allele.

AB  - Examined the importance of prepulse length (PL) and prepulse-pulse interval in the expression of prepulse inhibition (PPI) and its modification by the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, ketamine (K) in male rats. In contrast to a previous report by the authors (see record [rid]1990-14216-001[/rid]) K disrupted PPI at doses of 5.6 and 10 mg/kg when its short time course was taken into consideration. In Exp 2, the amount of PPI was directly related to PL, with PPI produced by shorter prepulse durations being slightly more sensitive to disruption by K. In Exp 3, PPI produced by prepulses occurring 60–500 msec before the startle stimulus was disrupted by 10 mg/kg of K. In Exp 4, prepulse facilitation was enhanced by K. Results suggest that prestimulus modification of the startle reflex has important parametric and experiential determinants that may influence the effects of drugs. Some of these temporal determinants may have relevance to sensorimotor function in schizophrenia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cocaine consumption can induce transient psychotic symptoms, expressed as paranoia or hallucinations. Cocaine induced psychosis (CIP) is common but not developed in all cases. This is the first European study on the relationship between CIP, consumption pattern variables and personality disorders. We evaluated 173 cocaine-dependent patients over 18 years; mostly males, whose average age was 33.6 years (SD = 7.8). Patients attending an outpatient addictions department were enrolled in the study and subsequently systematically evaluated using SCID I and SCID II interviews for comorbid disorders, a clinical interview for psychotic symptoms and EuropASI for severity of addiction. A high proportion of cocaine dependent patients reported psychotic symptoms under the influence of cocaine (53.8%), the most frequently reported being paranoid beliefs and suspiciousness (43.9%). A logistic regression analysis was performed, finding that a model consisting of amount of cocaine consumption, presence of an antisocial personality disorder and cannabis dependence history had 66.2% sensitivity 75.8% specificity predicting the presence of CIP. In our conclusions, we discuss the relevance of evaluating CIP in all cocaine dependent-patients, and particularly in those fulfilling the clinical profile derived from our results. These findings could be useful for a clinical approach to the risks of psychotic states in cocaine-dependent patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cocaine dependence is a neuropsychiatric disorder in which both environmental and genetic factors are involved. Several processes, that include reward and neuroadaptations, mediate the transition from use to dependence. In this regard, dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission systems are clearly involved in reward and other cocaine‐related effects, whereas neurotrophic factors may be responsible for neuroadaptations associated with cocaine dependence. We examined the contribution to cocaine dependence of 37 genes related to the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems, neurotrophic factors and their receptors through a case–control association study with 319 single nucleotide polymorphisms selected according to genetic coverage criteria in 432 cocaine‐dependent patients and 482 sex‐matched unrelated controls. Single marker analyses provided evidence for association of the serotonin receptor HTR2A with cocaine dependence [rs6561333; nominal P‐value adjusted for age = 1.9e−04, odds ratio = 1.72 (1.29–2.30)]. When patients were subdivided according to the presence or absence of psychotic symptoms, we confirmed the association between cocaine dependence and HTR2A in both subgroups of patients. Our data show additional evidence for the involvement of the serotoninergic system in the genetic susceptibility to cocaine dependence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rationale: Our study stems from four related lines of evidence: (1) FGF-2 is expressed in the developing brain; (2) psychostimulants modulate FGF-2 expression; (3) stress alters FGF-2 expression; and (4) exogenous administration of FGF-2 long-lastingly alters cocaine acquisition of self-administration. Objectives: This research aims to study the effects of adolescent cocaine exposure on FGF-2 mRNA levels and its influence on the response to stress. Materials and methods: Rats were treated subcutaneously with saline or cocaine from postnatal day (PND) 28 to PND 42, a period that roughly approximates adolescence in humans. At PND 45 and PND 90, rats were exposed to an acute stress. Real-time PCRs were performed on total RNA extracted from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and striatum. Results: In the prefrontal cortex, repeated cocaine treatment during adolescence increased FGF-2 mRNA levels in PND 90 rats and altered its response to an acute stress in both PND 45 and PND 90 rats. In the hippocampus of PND 45 rats, we found an increase of FGF-2 mRNA levels following repeated cocaine administration. No changes in the trophic factor gene expression were found in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. Conclusions: Our data show that cocaine exposure during adolescence alters FGF-2 mRNA levels throughout life in rat prefrontal cortex and modulates its response to an adverse event. These results point to FGF-2 as a potential molecular target through which exposure to cocaine early in life may dynamically and persistently alter brain homeostasis.

AB  - Examined the acute and chronic effects of cocaine in 3 groups of pigeons. One group was exposed to a simple fixed ratio (FR) 5 schedule of food delivery, a 2nd group to a simple FR 125 schedule of food delivery, and a 3rd to a simple FR 125 schedule that alternated across sessions with a multiple FR 125 FR 250 schedule. When administered acutely, cocaine (1–20 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent rate decreases under all schedules. With chronic exposure to 5.56 mg/kg cocaine, tolerance clearly developed under the FR 5 schedule. Results suggest that tolerance to cocaine does not develop readily under long FR schedules, regardless of the context in which they appear.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 132(1) of Pediatrics (see record [rid]2013-24015-021[/rid]). In the original article, on page e1485, in the first row heading of Table 4, the headings read: 'Variable, Externalizing, Internalizing, Total, Attention, Variable, Externalizing, Internalizing, Total.' These should have read: 'Variable, Externalizing, Internalizing, Total, Attention'.] Background: We determined the role of risk and protective factors on the trajectories of behavior problems associated with high prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE)/polydrug exposure. Methods: The Maternal Lifestyle Study enrolled 1388 children with or without PCE, assessed through age 15 years. Because most women using cocaine during pregnancy also used other substances, we analyzed for the effects of 4 categories of prenatal drug exposure: high PCE/other drugs (OD), some PCE/OD, OD/no PCE, and no PCE/no OD. Risks and protective factors at individual, family, and community levels that may be associated with behavior outcomes were entered stepwise into latent growth curve models, then replaced by cumulative risk and protective indexes, and finally by a combination of levels of risk and protective indexes. Main outcome measures were the trajectories of externalizing, internalizing, total behavior, and attention problems scores from the Child Behavior Checklist (parent). Results: A total of 1022 (73.6%) children had known outcomes. High PCE/OD significantly predicted externalizing, total, and attention problems when considering the balance between risk and protective indexes. Some PCE/OD predicted externalizing and attention problems. OD/no PCE also predicted behavior outcomes except for internalizing behavior. High level of protective factors was associated with declining trajectories of problem behavior scores over time, independent of drug exposure and risk index scores. Conclusions: High PCE/OD is a significant risk for behavior problems in adolescence; protective factors may attenuate its detrimental effects. Clinical practice and public health policies should consider enhancing protective factors while minimizing risks to improve outcomes of drug-exposed children.

AB  - Rationale: Two pharmacological stressors commonly used in the study of stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking are central injections of the stress peptide, corticotropinreleasing factor (CRF), and systemic administration of the α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine. Despite the widespread use of these stressors, the neurochemical systems mediating their ability to reinstate cocaine-seeking behaviour have not been fully characterized. Objective: The present study was designed to characterize the role, specifically, of dopamine transmission in the reinstating effects of CRF and yohimbine on cocaine seeking. Methods: Male Long-Evans rats were trained to selfadminister cocaine (0.23 mg/kg/infusion) for 8–10 days. Subsequently, responding for drug was extinguished, and tests for CRF- (0.5 μg; i.c.v.) and yohimbine-induced (1.25 mg/kg; i.p.) reinstatement were conducted following pretreatment with the dopamine D1/5 receptor antagonists, SCH23390 (0.05, 0.1 mg/kg; i.p.) and/or SCH31966 (0.2 mg/kg; i.p.), and the D2/3 receptor antagonist, raclopride (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg; i.p.). Results: Pretreatment with SCH23390, but not raclopride, blocked CRF-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Pretreatment with SCH23390 and SCH31966, but not raclopride, blocked yohimbine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that transmission at D1/5, but not D2/3, receptors mediates the reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by CRF and yohimbine.

AB  - Finding genetic polymorphisms and mutations linked to addictive behavior can provide important targets for pharmaceutical and therapeutic interventions. Forward genetic approaches in model organisms such as zebrafish provide a potentially powerful avenue for finding new target genes. In order to validate this use of zebrafish, the molecular nature of its reward system must be characterized. We have previously reported the use of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) as a reliable method for screening mutagenized fish for defects in the reward pathway. Here we test if CPP in zebrafish involves the dopaminergic system by co-treating fish with cocaine and dopaminergic antagonists. Sulpiride, a potent D2 receptor (DR2) antagonist, blocked cocaine-induced CPP, while the D1 receptor (DR1) antagonist SCH23390 had no effect. Acute cocaine exposure also induced a rise in the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an important enzyme in dopamine synthesis, and a significant decrease in the expression of elongation factor 1α (EF1α), a housekeeping gene that regulates protein synthesis. Cocaine selectively increased the ratio of TH/EF1α in the telencephalon, but not in other brain regions. The cocaine-induced change in TH/EF1α was blocked by co-treatment with sulpiride, but not SCH23390, correlating closelywith the action of these drugs on the CPP behavioral response. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the drop in EF1α was selective for the dorsal nucleus of the ventral telencephalic area (Vd), a region believed to be the teleost equivalent of the striatum. Examination of TH mRNA and EF1α transcripts suggests that regulation of expression is post-transcriptional, but this requires further examination. These results highlight important similarities and differences between zebrafish and more traditional mammalian model organisms. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction and Aims: Crack cocaine pipe sharing is associated with various health-related harms, including hepatitis C transmission. Although difficulty accessing crack pipes has been found to predict pipe sharing, little is known about the factors that limit pipe access in settings where pipes are provided at no cost, albeit in limited capacity.Therefore, we investigated crack pipe access among people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada. Design and Methods: Data were collected through two Canadian prospective cohort studies. Generalised estimating equations with logit link for binary outcomes were used to identify factors associated with difficulty accessing crack pipes. Results: Among 914 participants who reported using crack cocaine, 33% reported difficulty accessing crack pipes. In multivariate analyses, factors independently associated with difficulty accessing crack pipes included: sex work involvement [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–2.39], having shared a crack pipe (AOR = 1.69;95% CI: 1.32–2.16), police presence where one buys/uses drugs (AOR = 1.47;95% CI: 1.10–1.95), difficulty accessing services (AOR = 1.74;95% CI: 1.31–2.32) and health problems associated with crack use (AOR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.04–1.79). Reasons given for difficulty accessing pipes included sources being closed (48.2%) and no one around selling pipes (18.1%). Discussion and Conclusions: A substantial proportion of people who smoke crack cocaine report difficulty accessing crack pipes in a setting where pipes are available at no cost but in limited quantity. These findings indicate the need for enhanced efforts to distribute crack pipes and address barriers to pipe access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Growth factors are critical in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity, and recent studies point to their involvement in addiction. We previously reported increased levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) in high novelty/drug-seeking rats (bred high responders, bHR) compared to low novelty/drug-seeking rats (bred low responders, bLRs). The present study asked whether an early life manipulation of the FGF system (a single FGF2 injection on postnatal day 2) can impact cocaine sensitization and associated neurobiological markers in adult bHR/bLR animals. Neonatal FGF2- and vehicle-treated bHR/bLR rats were sensitized to cocaine (7 daily injections, 15 mg/kg/day, i.p.) in adulthood. Neonatal FGF2 markedly increased bLRs' typically low psychomotor sensitization to cocaine (day 7 locomotor response to cocaine), but had little effect on bHRs' cocaine sensitization. Gene expression studies examined dopaminergic molecules as well as FGF2 and the FGFR1 receptor in cocaine naïve animals, to investigate possible neurobiological alterations induced by neonatal FGF2 exposure that may influence behavioral response to cocaine. bLRs showed decreased tyrosine hydroxylase in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), decreased D1 and increased D2 receptor expression in the nucleus accumbens core, as well as decreased FGF2 in the VTA, substantia nigra, accumbens core, and caudate putamen compared to bHRs. Neonatal FGF2 selectively increased D1 receptor and FGF2 mRNA in the accumbens core of bLRs, which may contribute to their heightened cocaine sensitization. Our results suggest increased FGF2 in the mesodopaminergic circuit (as in baseline bHRs and neonatal FGF2-exposed bLRs vs. baseline bLRs) enhances an individual's susceptibility to cocaine sensitization and may increase vulnerability to drug seeking and addiction.

AB  - Prenatal cocaine exposure leads to persistent alterations in the growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus, brain regions important in cognitive functioning. BDNF plays an important role in the strengthening of existing synaptic connections as well as in the formation of new contacts during learning. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene (Val66Met), leading to a Met substitution for Val at codon 66 in the prodomain, is common in human populations, with an allele frequency of 20–30% in Caucasians. To study the interaction between prenatal cocaine exposure and BDNF, we have utilized a line of BDNF Val66Met transgenic mice on a Swiss Webster background in which BDNFMet is endogenously expressed. Examination of baseline levels of mature BDNF protein in the mPFC of prenatally cocaine-treated wild-type (Val66Val) and Val66Met mice revealed significantly lower levels compared to prenatally saline-treated mice. In contrast, in the hippocampus of prenatally saline- and cocaine-treated adult Val66Met mice, there were significantly lower levels of mature BDNF protein compared to Val66Val mice. In extinction of a conditioned fear, we found that prenatally cocaine-treated Val66Met mice had a deficit in recall of extinction. Examination of mature BDNF protein levels immediately after the test for extinction recall revealed lower levels in the mPFC of prenatally cocaine-treated Val66Met mice compared to saline-treated mice. However, 2 h after the extinction test, there was increased BDNF exons I, IV, and IX mRNA expression in the prelimbic cortex of the mPFC in the prenatally cocaine-treated BDNF Val66Met mice compared to prenatally saline-treated mice. Taken together, our results suggest the possibility that prenatal cocaine-induced constitutive alterations in BDNF mRNA and protein expression in the mPFC differentially poises animals for alterations in behaviorally induced gene activation, which are interactive with BDNF genotype and differentially impact those behaviors. Such findings in our prenatal cocaine mouse model suggest a gene X environment interaction of potential clinical relevance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) has been reported to provide tropic support for neurons in the CNS. However, whether PDGF-BB regulates neurogenesis, especially in the context of HIV-associated neurological disorder and drug abuse, remains essentially unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that pretreatment of rat hippocampal neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) with PDGF-BB restored proliferation that had been impaired by HIV Tat– cocaine via the cognate receptors. We identify the essential role of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels in PDGF-BB-mediated proliferation. Parallel but distinct ERK/CREB, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/ Akt signaling pathways with downstream activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP)–p70S6K and nuclear factor-k B were critical for proliferation. Blocking TRPC1 channel suppressed PDGF-mediated proliferation as well as PDGF-BB-induced ERK/CREB and mTOR/4E-BP–p70S6K activation, thereby underscoring its role in this process. In vivo relevance of these findings was further corroborated in Tat transgenic mice wherein hippocampal injection of recombinant AAV2–PDGF-B restored impaired NPC proliferation that was induced by Tat– cocaine. Together, these data underpin the role of TRPC1 channel as a novel target that regulates cell proliferation mediated by PDGF-BB with implications for therapeutic intervention for reversal of impaired neurogenesis inflicted by Tat and cocaine.

AB  - Objectives: Cocaine consumption can induce transient psychotic symptoms expressed as paranoia or hallucinations. This work reviews that evidence and tries to obtain data regarding frequency of psychotic symptoms or cocaine induced psychosis (CIP), risks and associated factors. Method: Systematic review of studies found in PubMed database published until January 2011 where cocaine induced paranoia was present. Results: Cocaine induced paranoia has a particular clinical presentation. It needs to be clearly identified due to its harmful consequences. The prevalence is between 12% in clinical studies and 100% in experimental studies. The following are considered potential risk factors: age of first use and length, amount of substance, route of administration, body mass index, genetic factors, personal vulnerability and comorbidity with AXIS I (psychosis, ADHD) and AXIS II disorders (antisocial personality disorder). Conclusions: It is needed to research with larger samples of cocaine users of different countries and contexts, in order to identify and detail what variables are closely related in the development of cocaine induced paranoia, so the population at risk can be treated earlier.

AB  - The molecular mechanism underlying induction by cocaine of ΔFosB, a transcription factor important for addiction, remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate a necessary role for two transcription factors, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and serum response factor (SRF), in mediating this induction within the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region. CREB and SRF are both activated in NAc by cocaine and bind to the fosB gene promoter. Using viral-mediated Cre recombinase expression in the NAc of singleor double-floxed mice, we show that deletion of both transcription factors from this brain region completely blocks cocaine induction of ΔFosB in NAc, whereas deletion of either factor alone has no effect. Furthermore, deletion of both SRF and CREB from NAc renders animals less sensitive to the rewarding effects of moderate doses of cocaine when tested in the conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure and also blocks locomotor sensitization to higher doses of cocaine. Deletion of CREB alone has the opposite effect and enhances both cocaine CPP and locomotor sensitization. In contrast to ΔFosB induction by cocaine, ΔFosB induction in NAc by chronic social stress, which we have shown previously requires activation of SRF, is unaffected by the deletion of CREB alone. These surprising findings demonstrate the involvement of distinct transcriptional mechanisms in mediating ΔFosB induction within this same brain region by cocaine versus stress. Our results also establish a complex mode of regulation of ΔFosB induction in response to cocaine, which requires the concerted activities of both SRF and CREB.

AB  - Background: Patterns of heroin and cocaine use vary and may be associated with unique risk factors for bloodborne infections. Methods: Latent class analysis identified sub-populations of 552 heroin and cocaine users in Baltimore, Maryland. Using latent class regression, these classes were analyzed for associations with demographic characteristics, risky behaviors, Hepatitis C, and HIV. Results: Three classes were found: Crack/Nasal-Heroin users (43.5%), Polysubstance users (34.8%), and Heroin Injectors (21.8%). Compared to Polysubstance users, Crack/Nasal-Heroin users were almost 7 times more likely to identify as Black (OR=6.97, 95% CI=4.35–11.2). Sharing needles was over 2.5 times more likely among Polysubstance users than among Heroin Injectors (OR=2.66, 95% CI=1.49–4.75). Crack/Nasal-Heroin users were 2.5 times more likely than Polysubstance users to exchange drugs for sex (OR=2.50, 95% CI=1.22–5.13). Crack/Nasal-Heroin users were less likely than Heroin Injectors to have Hepatitis C (OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.06–0.18), but no significant differences were found for HIV. Conclusions: Subpopulations of cocaine and heroin users differed in demographic classifications, HIV-risk behaviors, and Hepatitis C infection. All subpopulations included substantial numbers of HIV-positive individuals. Findings provide further evidence that non-injection drug users face significant infectious disease risk.

AB  - Describes the use of an animal model, the inbred mouse, to identify and to characterize variants with inherently altered susceptibilities to the rewarding and other behavioral actions of cocaine. Studies are reviewed which show that among a battery of inbred strains chosen solely for their genetic diversity, genetic polymorphisms commonly occurred which altered the potency and/or efficacy of cocaine to induce conditioned place preference, oral self-administration, motor activity activation, seizures and lethality. These changes in cocaine sensitivity were of a behavior-specific and pharmacodynamic nature. The existence of different phenotypic classes of variants displaying altered vulnerabilities to cocaine suggests that different genotypic changes underlie each class.

AB  - This study is aimed to clarify the association between MDMA cumulative use and cognitive dysfunction, and the potential role of candidate genetic polymorphisms in explaining individual differences in the cognitive effects of MDMA. Gene polymorphisms related to reduced serotonin function, poor competency of executive control and memory consolidation systems, and high enzymatic activity linked to bioactivation of MDMA to neurotoxic metabolites may contribute to explain variations in the cognitive impact of MDMA across regular users of this drug. Sixty ecstasy polydrug users, 110 cannabis users and 93 non-drug users were assessed using cognitive measures of Verbal Memory (California Verbal Learning Test, CVLT), Visual Memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, ROCFT), Semantic Fluency, and Perceptual Attention (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, SDMT). Participants were also genotyped for polymorphisms within the 5HTT, 5HTR2A, COMT, CYP2D6, BDNF, and GRIN2B genes using polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan polymerase assays. Lifetime cumulative MDMA use was significantly associated with poorer performance on visuospatial memory and perceptual attention. Heavy MDMA users (.100 tablets lifetime use) interacted with candidate gene polymorphisms in explaining individual differences in cognitive performance between MDMA users and controls. MDMA users carrying COMT val/val and SERT s/s had poorer performance than paired controls on visuospatial attention and memory, and MDMA users with CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers performed worse than controls on semantic fluency. Both MDMA lifetime use and gene-related individual differences influence cognitive dysfunction in ecstasy users. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rationale: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist which interferes with the action of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) including glutamate and aspartate. The use of ketamine at subanaesthetic doses has increased because of its psychotomimetic properties. However, long-term ketamine abuse may interfere with memory processes and inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, an effect probably mediated by its NMDA antagonist action. Neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) serve as survival factors for selected populations of central nervous system neurons, including cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons. In addition, neurotrophins, particularly BDNF, may regulate LTP in the hippocampus and influence synaptic plasticity. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that ketamine use in humans is associated with altered serum levels of neurotrophins. Methods: We measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the NGF and BDNF serum levels in two groups of subjects: frequent ketamine users and healthy subjects. Results: Our data show that BDNF serum levels were increased in chronic ketamine users as compared to healthy subjects, while NGF levels were not affected by ketamine use. Conclusion: These findings suggest that chronic ketamine intake is associated with increases in BDNF serum levels in humans. Other studies are needed to explore the pharmacological and molecular mechanism by which ketamine, and/or other NMDA antagonists, may induce modification in the production and utilization of BDNF and alter normal brain function.

AB  - This study examined ecstasy use and associated risk and protective factors among Asian American youth. Data from 996 Asian American adolescents and 1,108 Asian American young adults were used. Ecstasy use was relatively common among Asian American youth. Among adolescents, it was associated with older age, poor parent-child communication, having been approached by drug sellers, living in a metropolitan area, and positive attitudes toward substance use. Among Asian American young adults, it was associated with having been born in the United States, having been approached by drug sellers, criminal justice system involvement, and positive attitudes toward substance use. Implications for designing substance use prevention/intervention programs for this minority group are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studied the operant behavior of 4 rhesus monkeys during 1-hr sessions in which iv cocaine (COC) or saline (SL) was available on an FR 10 schedule of reinforcement. Examination of the temporal characteristics of the behavior revealed differences between COC and SL, and between 2 doses of COC, 33 and 100 μg/kg/infusion. Rates of SL self-administration decreased rapidly after the first 15 min of the session, whereas rates of COC-maintained responding changed less in successive segments of the session. Results suggest a temporal complexity in drug self-administration behavior which may help to explain some of its determinants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 80 former cocaine sellers (aged 18–60 yrs), mostly wholesalers, were recruited and interviewed for a study exploring the reasons people stop selling cocaine. The motivations to stop selling were often complex. 40% of the respondents reported criminal justice concerns; however, 45% cited psychological problems and 35% physical health problems. The majority of the sellers cited relationship and sexual problems. Nearly a third reported that pressures from a spouse or lover were important to their decision to quit, and about 20% claimed pressures from family (children, parents, etc.) helped shape their decision. When asked to rank the most important reasons why they stopped selling cocaine, 2 out of every 5 reported they 'disliked the lifestyle associated with drug sales.' This meant a combination of their own drug use, psychological and physical problems, the illegal nature of the activity, and the problems dealing with other drug users and sellers.

AB  - Locomotor responses to repeated daily injections of cocaine (COC) or saline followed by challenge injections were studied in 24 male rats in quiet wakefulness after long-term habituation to an environment and in an activated state associated with S placement in a new environment. To evaluate the significance of various environmental events associated and unassociated with the drug's effect, the influence of repeated COC treatment on S reactivity to the procedure of injection (needle prick), a placement in environment of previous treatment, and an indifferent stressogenic stimulus (tailpinch) were also studied. Under activated conditions, locomotor activation by the 1st COC injection was significantly compared with that for saline Ss and Ss in a quiet state. Overall results suggest that COC's reinforcing action (i.e., its ability to enhance the significance of the state evoked by it) is the initial cause for the behavioral sensitization.

AB  - The Val66Met polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) gene results in alterations in fear extinction behavior in both human populations and mouse models. However, it is not clear whether this polymorphism plays a similar role in extinction of appetitive behaviors. Therefore, we examined operant learning and extinction of both food and cocaine self-administration behavior in an inbred genetic knock-in mouse strain expressing the variant Bdnf. These mice provide a unique opportunity to relate alterations in aversive and appetitive extinction learning as well as provide insight into how human genetic variation can lead to differences in behavior. BDNFMet ⁄ Met mice exhibited a severe deficit in operant learning as demonstrated by an inability to learn the food self-administration task. Therefore, extinction experiments were performed comparing wildtype (BDNFVal ⁄ Val) animals to mice heterozygous for the Met allele (BDNFVal ⁄ Met), which did not differ in food or cocaine self-administration behavior. In contrast to the deficit in fear extinction previously demonstrated in these mice, we found that BDNFVal ⁄ Met mice exhibited more rapid extinction of cocaine responding compared to wildtype mice. No differences were found between the genotypes in the extinction of food self-administration behavior or the reinstatement of cocaine seeking, indicating that the effect is specific to extinction of cocaine responding. These results suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying aversive and appetitive extinction are distinct from one another and BDNF may play opposing roles in the two phenomena.

AB  - Cocaine‐induced neuroadaptation of stress‐related circuitry and increased access to cocaine each putatively contribute to the transition from cocaine use to cocaine dependence. The present study tested the hypothesis that rats receiving extended versus brief daily access to cocaine would exhibit regional differences in levels of the stress‐regulatory neuropeptide corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF). A secondary goal was to explore how CRF levels change in relation to the time since cocaine self‐administration. Male Wistar rats acquired operant self‐administration of cocaine and were assigned to receive daily long access (6 hours/day, LgA, n = 20) or short access (1 hour/day, ShA, n = 18) to intravenous cocaine self‐administration (fixed ratio 1, ∼0.50 mg/kg/infusion). After at least 3 weeks, tissue CRF immunoreactivity was measured at one of three timepoints: pre‐session, post‐session or 3 hours post‐session. LgA, but not ShA, rats showed increased total session and first‐hour cocaine intake. CRF immunoreactivity increased within the dorsal raphe (DR) and basolateral, but not central, nucleus of the amygdala (BLA, CeA) of ShA rats from pre‐session to 3 hours post‐session. In LgA rats, CRF immunoreactivity increased from pre‐session to 3 hours post‐session within the CeA and DR but tended to decrease in the BLA. LgA rats showed higher CRF levels than ShA rats in the DR and, pre‐session, in the BLA. Thus, voluntary cocaine intake engages stress‐regulatory CRF systems of the DR and amygdala. Increased availability of cocaine promotes greater tissue CRF levels in these extrahypothalamic brain regions, changes associated here with a model of cocaine dependence.

AB  - Rationale: Enhanced sensitivity to the euphoric and locomotor-activating effects of psychostimulants may influence an individual's predisposition to drug abuse and addiction. While drug-induced behaviors are mediated by the actions of several neurotransmitter systems, past research revealed that the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system is important in driving the acute locomotor response to psychostimulants. Objectives: We previously reported that genetic deletion of the CRF type-2 receptor (CRF-R2), but not the CRF type-1 receptor (CRF-R1) dampened the acute locomotor stimulant response to methamphetamine (1 mg/kg). These results contrasted with previous studies implicating CRF-R1 in the locomotor effects of psychostimulants. Since the majority of previous studies focused on cocaine, rather than methamphetamine, we set out to test the hypothesis that these drugs differentially engage CRF-R1 and CRF-R2. Methods: We expanded our earlier findings by first replicating our previous experiments at a higher dose of methamphetamine (2 mg/kg), and by assessing the effects of the CRF-R1-selective antagonist CP-376,395 (10 mg/kg) on methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity. Next, we used both genetic and pharmacological tools to examine the specific components of the CRF system underlying the acute locomotor response to cocaine (5–10 mg/kg). Results: While genetic deletion of CRF-R2 dampened the locomotor response to methamphetamine (but not cocaine), genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of CRF-R1 dampened the locomotor response to cocaine (but not methamphetamine). Conclusions: These findings highlight the differential involvement of CRF receptors in acute sensitivity to two different stimulant drugs of abuse, providing an intriguing basis for the development of more targeted therapeutics for psychostimulant addiction.

AB  - Significant sex differences have been demonstrated in clinical and preclinical studies of cocaine addiction, with some of the most consistent differences noted in regard to the role of stress and craving. The current study examined stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking in male and female rats in an animal model of relapse using corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) administration. Both male and female rats demonstrated increased cocaine seeking in response to CRF. CRF-induced reinstatement was highly variable across both male and female rats, and further analysis revealed a subpopulation that was particularly sensitive to CRF (high responders). Female high responders displayed significantly increased responding to CRF compared to males. Individual differences in stress responsivity could thus contribute to the likelihood of relapse, with females showing greater heterogeneity to stress-induced relapse.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that the persistence of cocaine seeking during periods of protracted drug abstinence following chronic cocaine exposure is mediated, in part, by neuroadaptations in the mesolimbic dopamine system. Specifically, incubation of cocaine-seeking behavior coincides with increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate time-dependent changes in VTA BDNF protein expression during cocaine abstinence are unclear. The goal of these experiments was to determine whether VTA BDNF transcript levels are altered following cocaine abstinence and identify the molecular mechanisms regulating cocaine-induced changes in VTA BDNF transcription. Rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine (0.25 mg/infusion, i.v.) for 14 days on a fixed-ratio schedule of reinforcement followed by 7 days of forced drug abstinence. BDNF protein and exon I-containing transcripts were significantly increased in the VTA of cocaine-experienced rats following 7 days of forced drug abstinence compared to yoked saline controls. Cocaine-induced changes in BDNF mRNA were associated with increased acetylation of histone 3 and binding of CREB-binding protein to exon I-containing promoters in the VTA. Taken together, these results suggest that drug abstinence following cocaine self-administration remodels chromatin in the VTA resulting in increased expression of BDNF, which may contribute to neuroadaptations underlying cocaine craving and relapse.

AB  - We demonstrated that the genotype of the variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) in the linked polymorphic region (LPR) of the 5′ promoter and in the intron 2 (Stin2) transcriptional regulatory domains of the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 gene determined its promoter interactions with transcription factors and co-activators in response to cocaine in the JAr cell line. The LPR variants contain 14 (short, s) or 16 (long, l) copies of a 22–23 bp repeat element, whereas the Stin2 VNTR exists as three variants containing 9, 10 or 12 copies of a 16–17 bp repeat.We observed a differential effect of cocaine on the association of the promoter with the transcription factor CTCF,which bound to both LPR alleles prior to cocaine exposure but only to the l-allele following exposure. Significantly, this differential effect of cocaine was correlated with the binding of the transcriptional regulator MeCP2 specifically to the s-allele and recruiting the histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). Concurrently, cocaine increased the association of positive histone marks over the SLC6A4 gene locus. At the Stin2 domain,we lost binding of the transcription factor YB-1,while CTCF remained bound. Our biochemical data are consistent with differential reporter gene activity directed by the individual or dual domains in response to cocaine in an Epstein–Barr virus-based episome model of stable transfections. These observations suggest that exposure of JAr cells to cocaine may result in differential binding of transcription factors and activators based on a specific genotype that might alter epigenetic parameters affecting gene expression after the initial challenge.

AB  - Distinct forms of MEF2 transcription factor act as positive or negative regulators of dendritic spine formation, with MEF2C playing a key regulator role in synapse plasticity. We report here that acute cocaine treatment of rats induced the expression of MEF2C in the striatum through a recently discovered transduction pathway. Repeated injections were found to induce MEF2C to a lesser extent. The mechanism by which MEF2C was induced involves the subsequent activation of the salt‐inducible kinase SIK1 and the phosphorylation of HDAC5, a member of the class IIa of HDACs. Cocaine activated SIK1 by phosphorylation on Thr‐182 residue, which was accompanied by the nuclear import of the kinase. In the nuclear compartment, SIK1 then phosphorylated HDAC5 causing the shuttling of its phospho‐form from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of striatal cells. Activation of SIK1 by cocaine was further validated by the phosphorylation of TORC1/3, which was followed by the shuttling of TORC proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Activation of MEF2C was assessed by measuring the expression of the MEF2C gene itself, since the gene is known to be under the control of its own product. Since MEF2C plays a key role in memory/learning processes, activation of this pathway by cocaine is probably involved in plasticity mechanisms whereby the drug establishes its long‐term effects such as drug dependence.

AB  - The present study assessed the factor structure, reliability, test retest, convergent validity, and predictive validity of the Obsessive Compulsive Cocaine Scale (OCCS), a newly developed questionnaire adapted from the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). The questionnaire was administered to 189 cocaine-dependent individuals participating in two medication treatment trials for cocaine dependence. Confirmatory factor analysis of this measure revealed that it primarily assesses two factors, obsessions and compulsions. In addition, the data provided strong support for the internal consistency, test–retest reliability, predictive validity, and convergent validity of this two-factor measure. Overall, the data provide support for the psychometric strength of a modified version of the OCDS specifically designed to assess obsessive and compulsive cocaine use among those with cocaine dependence.

AB  - Background: Cocaine dependence is associated with high relapse rates, but few biological markers associated with relapse outcomes have been identified. Extending preclinical research showing a role for central brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in cocaine seeking, we examined whether serum BDNF is altered in abstinent, early recovering, cocaine-dependent individuals and whether it is predictive of subsequent relapse risk. Methods: Serum samples were collected across three consecutive mornings from 35 treatment-engaged, 3-week-abstinent cocaine-dependent inpatients (17 males/18 females) and 34 demographically matched hospitalized healthy control participants (17 males/17 females). Cocaine-dependent individuals were prospectively followed on days 14, 30, and 90 posttreatment discharge to assess cocaine relapse outcomes. Time to cocaine relapse, number of days of cocaine use (frequency), and amount of cocaine use (quantity) were the main outcome measures. Results: High correlations in serum BDNF across days indicated reliable and stable serum BDNF measurements. Significantly higher mean serum BDNF levels were observed for the cocaine-dependent patients compared with healthy control participants (p < .001). Higher serum BDNF levels predicted shorter subsequent time to cocaine relapse (hazard ratio: 1.09, p < .05), greater number of days (p < .05), and higher total amounts of cocaine used (p = .05). Conclusions: High serum BDNF levels in recovering cocaine-dependent individuals are predictive of future cocaine relapse outcomes and may represent a clinically relevant marker of relapse risk. These data suggest that serum BDNF levels may provide an indication of relapse risk during early recovery from cocaine dependence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 40(47) of The Journal of Neuroscience (see record [rid]2020-88208-010[/rid]). In the original article, on page 12452, within Figure 4D, an erroneous image of the Western blot for β-actin in the left and right panels was included. This error does not affect the conclusions of the article. The updated Figure 4 is present in the erratum.] Neuroinflammation associated with HIV-1 infection is exacerbated in cocaine-abusing, HIV+ individuals. The underlying mechanisms are, in part, attributable to disruption of the blood– brain barrier modulated by cocaine via platelet-derived growth factor B chain (PDGF-B). Since Notch signaling plays a critical role in CNS homeostasis, we hypothesized that it may have a role in cocaine-mediated induction of PDGF-B. The goal of this study was to link Notch signaling with PDGF-B. Using Western blot analysis, we demonstrate the role of Notch1 signaling in cocaine-mediated induction of PDGF-B in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Exposure of cells to the γ-secretase inhibitor-DAPT or silencing of Notch1 resulted in abrogation of cocaine-mediated induction of PDGF-B. Reciprocally, activation of the Notch1 receptor by exposing cells to the Notch ligand Jagged-1 resulted in upregulation of PDGF-B expression. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that cocaine-mediated activation of Notch1 signaling leading to targeted expression of PDGF-B involved activation of the downstream effector CSL. Functional implication of Notch1 signaling in regulating expression of the vascular permeant PDGF-B was confirmed in vitro using cell permeability assays. In vivo relevance was further corroborated in cocaine-treated mice that demonstrated increased permeability of the endothelial barrier as evidenced by Evans blue and sodium fluorescein extravasation. Specificity of Notch1 signaling in vivo was validated in mice exposed to DAPT, which failed to demonstrate barrier disruption following cocaine exposure. This is the first evidence of involvement of Notch1 activation in cocaine-mediated regulation of PDGF-B expression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Data suggests that brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) plays a neuroadaptive role in addiction. Whether serum BDNF levels are different in alcohol or psychostimulants as a function of craving is unknown. Here, we examined craving and serum BDNF levels in persons with alcohol versus psychostimulant dependence. Our goals were to explore BDNF as an objective biomarker for 1) craving 2) abstinence, and 3) years of chronic substance use. Methods: An exploratory, cross-sectional study was designed. Men and women between 20–65 years old with alcohol, cocaine, or methamphetamine dependence were eligible. A craving questionnaire was used to measure alcohol, cocaine and methamphetamine cravings. Serum levels of BDNF were measured using enzyme linked immunoassay. Analysis of variance, chi-square, and correlations were performed using a 95% confidence interval and a significance level of P < 0.05. Results: We found a significant difference in the mean craving score among alcohol, cocaine and methamphetamine dependent subjects. There were no significant influences of race, gender, psychiatric disorder or psychotropic medication on serum BDNF levels. We found that among psychostimulant users BDNF levels were significantly higher in men than in women when the number of abstinent days was statistically controlled. Further, a significant correlation between serum BDNF levels and the number of abstinent days since last psychostimulant use was found. Conclusion: These data suggest that BDNF may be a biomarker of abstinence in psychostimulant dependent subjects and inform clinicians about treatment initiatives. The results are interpreted with caution due to small sample size and lack of a control group. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Evidence suggests that the noradrenergic and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) systems play critical roles in relapse and stress-related behaviors. In particular, behavioral studies point to a serial signaling process initiated by β-adrenergic receptors that requires CRF receptor (CRFR)-dependent signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to produce stress-induced relapse to cocaine seeking. Methods: We used whole cell patch clamp recordings from acutely prepared mouse brain slices to examine the actions of β-adrenergic receptors and CRFR1 on excitatory transmission in BNST. We examined the effects of agonists of these receptors in slices prepared from naive, sham, and cocaine-conditioned mice. Results: β₁-adrenergic receptor activation within the BNST produces an enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission that requires CRFR1-dependent signaling. We show that chronic cocaine administration transiently disrupts β₁-adrenergic- and CRFR1-dependent enhancement of glutamatergic transmission, that this disruption wanes with time, and that it can be reintroduced with a cocaine challenge. Conclusions: In total, these studies identify a circuit mechanism within the BNST that may play an important role in CRF- and norepinephrine- regulated behaviors.

AB  - Introduction: Suicide, as the 11th leading cause of death in America, is a significant public health concern. Previous studies have shown that drug users are a population at especially high risk for suicidal ideation (SI). Although most people who think about killing themselves do not ultimately commit suicide, identifying those at risk for such thoughts is important. Methods: In this analysis, data from a sample of 462 cocaine-using women (87% African American) recruited using street outreach methods for a National Institute on Drug Abuse–funded study were examined to identify risk factors for lifetime SI. Sociodemographic factors, adverse childhood experiences, sexual behaviors, psychiatric comorbidities, and drug abuse and dependence were examined as potential risk factors using both bivariate and logistic regression analysis. Results: Fifty percent of the sample met at least one criterion for lifetime SI, and 32% of the sample reported a lifetime suicide attempt. In the final logistic regression model, childhood physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse, rape after the age of 15 years, posttraumatic stress disorder, and number of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, depression criteria met emerged as significant independent predictors of lifetime SI. Conclusion: These findings identify important risk factors for SI among female substance abusers in community settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We conducted a cross sectional study of 3958 college students in north of Iran in 2005 with an anonymous questionnaire that was adapted from the questionnaires used in 'Monitoring the future'. Three thousand seven hundred students responded (93.5%). Lifetime prevalence use of ecstasy, opium and cannabis was 4.3%, 2.7% and 2.4% respectively. The prevalence of current cigarette smoking was 19.5%. After the logistic regression, the factors influencing ecstasy use were use of other illicit drugs, alcohol and cigarette smoking (P < 0.000), widow or divorced (ρ = 0.007) and higher educational background of mother (ρ = 0.019).

AB  - Background: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; 'Ecstasy') is an amphetamine derivative with mild hallucinogenic and stimulant qualities. MDMA leads to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) neurotoxicity and has been linked to cognitive impairments. It remains unclear whether these impairments are due to MDMA versus other drug use. Method: Neurocognitive functioning was measured in a sample of abstinent polydrug users (n = 52) with a range of MDMA use and healthy nondrug controls (n = 29). Participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and self-report measures of drug use. Results: Polydrug users performed worse than controls on spatial span and spatial working memory (ps < .05). Among polydrug users, lifetime marijuana use significantly predicted verbal learning and memory performance (p < .01), while MDMA use was not predictive of cognitive impairment. Conclusions: This study and our previous report (Hanson, Luciana, & Sullwold, 2008) suggest that moderate MDMA use does not lead to persistent impairments above and beyond that associated with generally heavy drug use, but polydrug use may lead to dose-related temporal and frontoparietal dysfunction. Marijuana use may be particularly problematic. Cause-effect relations are unclear. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study aimed to determine the expression of GSK-3β and eEF2 for the first time and to investigate further the expression of mTOR in peripheral blood plasma after the ketamine treatment in depressed patients. The previous studies have focused on ketamine’s antidepressant effect in patients with refractory depression. However, we enrolled three patients with major depressive disorder without prior antidepressant treatment, which ensured that there was no remnant effect of antidepressant treatment on the investigated biomarkers in this study. In conclusion, ketamine ameliorates depression rapidly and robustly with acute increases in the expression of plasma mTOR, GSK-3β, and eEF2 phosphorylation in depressed patients. Large scale clinical studies are needed to clarify the relationship between the antidepressant effect of ketamine and the changes of plasma mTOR, GSK-3β, and eEF2.

AB  - Aims: The aim of this article was to investigate the factors associated with ecstasy use in school-aged teenagers. Methods: This was a longitudinal study of adolescent drug use, which was undertaken in three towns in Northern Ireland. A questionnaire was administered annually to participants. In this article ecstasy use patterns amongst a cohort of young people aged 14–16 years participating in the Belfast Youth Development Study (BYDS) was explored. Findings: The percentage of those who had used ecstasy at least once increased from 7% when aged 14 years to 9% at 15 and 13% at 16 years. Female gender, delinquency, problem behaviours at school and the number of evenings spent out with friends each week were found to be significant variables predicting ‘ever use’ of ecstasy in all 3 years by logistic regression. Conclusions: The findings suggest that ecstasy use patterns may be changing from their historical perception as a ‘party’ drug, as the demographic profile ecstasy of users in this study reflected the traditional profile of illicit drug use during adolescence, which raises challenges for addressing the problems associated with this drug.

AB  - Introduction and Aims: Considerable concern has been raised about associations between ecstasy use and mental health. Studies of ecstasy users typically investigate varying levels of lifetime use of ecstasy, and often fail to account for other drug use and sociodemographic characteristics of participants, which may explain mixed findings. The current study aimed to examine the relationship between patterns of recent (last six months) ecstasy use and psychological distress among current, regular ecstasy users, controlling for sociodemographic risk factors and patterns of other drug use. Design and Methods: Data were collected from regular ecstasy users (n = 752) recruited from each capital city in Australia as part of the Ecstasy and related Drugs Reporting System (EDRS). Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Data were analysed using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Seven per cent of the sample scored in the ‘high’ distress category and 55% in the ‘medium’ distress category. Patterns of ecstasy use were not independently associated with psychological distress. The strongest predictors of distress were female sex, lower education, unemployment, ‘binge’ drug use including ecstasy (use for >48 h without sleep), frequent cannabis use and daily tobacco use. Discussion and Conclusions: Regular ecstasy users have elevated levels of psychological distress compared with the general population; however, ecstasy use per se was not independently related to such distress. Other factors, including sociodemographic characteristics and other drug use patterns, appear to be more important. These findings highlight the importance of targeting patterns of polydrug use in order to reduce drug-related harm among regular ecstasy users.

AB  - Objective: The University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA) is a widely used tool for measuring subjects’ readiness to change substance-using behaviors. The aim of this study was to examine the factor structure of the Chinese version of the URICA (C-URICA) in Taiwanese adolescents who have used methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or methamphetamine (MAMP). Methods: Pre-test and post-test data from the C-URICA from 92 adolescents in a juvenile abstinence center who had used MDMA or MAMP were analyzed. We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the adequacy of the factor structure of the C-URICA. Results: CFA indicated that a three-factor structure (pre-contemplation, contemplation + action, maintenance) had a better goodness of fit than four-factor (pre-contemplation, contemplation, action, maintenance), and one-factor structures. Conclusions: The results indicated that the URICA may have different factor structures when used in the population different from the original adult population with alcohol drinking.

AB  - Aims/Objectives: Methylenedioxymethamphetamine affects the central serotonergic system, and there is some evidence for an association between ecstasy use (drugs sold as methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of self-reported depression and associated help-seeking among a sample of regular ecstasy users. A further aim was to examine the correlates of depressive symptomatology in this population. Materials and Methods: 100 regular ecstasy consumers (at least monthly use) were interviewed as part of the Ecstasy and Related Drug Reporting System in Tasmania, Australia. Participants were also administered epidemiological measures of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) and psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale). Results: One quarter (23%) of participants self-reported recent experience of depression, a rate notably greater than the general population. However, only one third of these participants had attended a health professional for this issue. A range of drug use factors (e.g. frequency and quantity of ecstasy use, frequent cannabis or methamphetamine use, intravenous drug use, polydrug use, binge drug use, harmful alcohol use, and elevated psychological dependence scores for ecstasy and methamphetamine) were associated with high levels of depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: These findings are consistent with an association between depressive symptomatology and ecstasy and other drug use. Harm reduction strategies which target drug use factors such as those identified in this study may also aid in the reduction of the experience of depression. Considering the low levels of help-seeking among this population, improving awareness and access to information and treatment for depression may also be important.

AB  - Risk perception, perceived behavioral control of obtaining ecstasy (PBC-obtaining), current ecstasy dependence, and recent depression have been associated with past ecstasy use, however, their utility in predicting ecstasy use has not been demonstrated. This study aimed to determine whether these four modifiable risk factors could predict ecstasy use after controlling for socio-demographic covariates and recent polydrug use. Data from 601 ecstasy users in the National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded TriCity Study of Club Drug Use, Abuse and Dependence were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Participants were interviewed twice within a 2-week period using standardized instruments. Thirteen percent (n = 80) of the participants reported using ecstasy between the two interviews. Low risk perception, high PBC-obtaining (an estimated ecstasy procurement time <24 h), and current ecstasy dependence were statistically associated with ecstasy use between the two interviews. Recent depression was not a significant predictor. Despite not being a target predictor, recent polydrug use was also statistically associated with ecstasy use. The present findings may inform the development of interventions targeting ecstasy users. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aims: To investigate adolescent pathways to ecstasy use by (1) examining how early onsets of smoking, drinking, and marijuana use are related to a child's risk of initiation of ecstasy use and (2) assessing the influence of other individual and parental factors on ecstasy use initiation. Methods: Data on 6426 adolescents (12–17 years old at baseline) from the National Survey of Parents and Youth (NSPY), a longitudinal, nationally representative household survey of youth and their parents, were used in the analyses. Information on youth substance use, including ecstasy use, as well as familial and parental characteristics, was available. Results: Initiation of ecstasy use is predicted by an adolescent's early initiation of smoking, drinking, or marijuana use. In particular, early initiation either of marijuana use, or of both smoking and drinking, increases a child's risk for ecstasy use initiation. Among the familial and parental variables, parent drug use emerged as significantly predictive of child initiation of ecstasy use; living with both parents and close parental monitoring, on the other hand, are negatively associated with ecstasy use initiation, and may be protective against it. At the individual level, sensation seeking tendencies and positive attitudes towards substance use, as well as close associations with deviant peers, are predictive of adolescent initiation of ecstasy use. Conclusion: Our findings on the risk and protective factors for initiation of ecstasy use, especially with regard to factors that are modifiable, will be useful for prevention programs targeting youth use not only of ecstasy, but also of other drugs.

AB  - Early developmental treatment of rats with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) was previously found to cause an abnormal pattern of forebrain serotonergic axon density in adulthood consisting of a cortical hypoinnervation and a striatal hyperinnervation. The present study tested the hypothesis that this reorganization was due to regional differences in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Rats received MDMA (10 mg/kg, s.c., b.i.d.) on postnatal days (PD) 1-4, after which brain tissues were collected on PD 11, 30, and 67 for analysis. BDNF protein levels were found to be elevated in the occipital cortex but not in the hippocampus or striatum following MDMA administration. Serotonin transporter binding (an index of serotonergic fiber integrity) was significantly reduced in the hippocampus at PD 11 but returned to normal by PD 30, whereas the cortex exhibited a delayed reduction that was not manifested until PD 30. These results do not support the view that a region-specific enhancement in BDNF expression mediates the abnormal serotonergic reinnervation observed following neonatal MDMA exposure.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate factors associated with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol and other drugs (ecstasy, cannabis and methamphetamine) among a group of regular ecstasy users. Participants were those who participated in the Australian Ecstasy and related Drug Reporting System (EDRS) in 2007 and had recently driven a motor vehicle (n = 573). Participants were administered a semi-structured face-to-face interview which included questions about ecstasy and other drug use, associated health-related issues, and risk behaviours. Close to half of those who were current consumers of ecstasy, cannabis, and methamphetamine had recently driven under the influence of these drugs, while two-fifths of current alcohol users reported recent drink driving. Frequency of use for each substance was the most significant correlate of DUI of alcohol, cannabis, and methamphetamine, suggesting that interventions targeting high frequency and problematic drug use may be useful in reducing the occurrence of DUI for these substances. Low perception of the likelihood of having an accident was the most significant correlate of DUI of ecstasy and also related significantly to DUI of other substances. Perceptions of low likelihood of being apprehended by police and demographic characteristics such as younger age and male sex were also weakly associated with DUI. Together these findings have important implications for targeted interventions aimed at reducing the occurrence of DUI among regular drug users.

AB  - The purposes of this study are to (1) examine the extent to which young adult Ecstasy users recently reported having had multiple sex partners and (2) identify the factors predictive of engaging in this behavior. Potential predictors included demographic characteristics, background and experiences measures, childhood maltreatment experiences, substance use variables, and measures assessing psychological/psychosocial functioning. This research is based on a sample of 283 young adult recurrent users of the drug, Ecstasy. Study participants were recruited in Atlanta, Georgia between August 2002 and August 2004 using a targeted sampling and ethnographic mapping approach. Interviews took approximately two hours to complete. Nearly one-third of the study participants had more than one sex partner during the preceding month, and sexual protection rates tended to be low. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed seven predictors associated with an increased likelihood of having multiple sex partners: (1) being nonwhite, (2) knowing someone who was HIV-positive, (3) younger age of first sexual experience, (4) using Ecstasy for its touch-enhancing qualities, (5) higher self-esteem, (6) handling disagreements more dysfunctionally, and (7) not being involved in a romantic relationship. The HIV prevention- and intervention-related implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cocaine self-administration alters patterns of gene expression in the brain that may underlie cocaine-induced neuronal plasticity. In the present study, male Sprague Dawley rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine (0.25 mg/infusion) 2 h/d for 14 d, followed by 7 d of forced abstinence. Compared with yoked saline control rats, cocaine self-administration resulted in increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To examine the functional relevance of this finding, cocaine self-administration maintained under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement was assessed after short hairpin RNA-induced suppression of BDNF expression in the mPFC. Decreased BDNF expression in the mPFC increased the cocaine self-administration breakpoint. Next, the effect of cocaine self-administration on specific BDNF exons was assessed; results revealed selectively increased BDNF exon IV-containing transcripts in the mPFC. Moreover, there were significant cocaine-induced increases in acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) and phospho-cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) association with BDNF promoter IV. In contrast, there was decreased methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) association with BDNF promoter IV in the mPFC of rats that previously self-administered cocaine. Together, these results indicate that cocaine-induced increases in BDNF promoter IV transcript in the mPFC are driven by increased binding of AcH3 and pCREB as well as decreased MeCP2 binding at this BDNF promoter. Collectively, these results indicate that cocaine self-administration remodels chromatin in the mPFC, resulting in increased expression of BDNF, which appears to represent a compensatory neuroadaptation that reduces the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) on cocaine use and cocaine injection among heroin users. Methods: Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine the association between MMT enrollment (0, < 12, ≥ 12 months) and changes in frequency of cocaine use or injection in two consecutive follow-up visits among heroin users in the Itinere cohort, and to determine whether these changes were independent of equivalent changes in heroin use or injection. Seven multivariate models were constructed, one for each outcome variable on drug use changes. Results: Of the 992 participants recruited in 2001–2003, 628 (63.3%) had at least one follow-up visit. Of these, 55.8% were enrolled in MMT at baseline and an additional 23.2% initiated MMT during follow-up. In multivariate GEE, changes significantly and positively associated with MMT enrollment were: less cocaine use [MMT < 12 months (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.17–2.48)] and less cocaine injection [MMT ≥ 12 months (OR=2.98, 95% CI = 1.51–5.89)]. Being on MMT≥12 months was negatively associated with more cocaine use (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.38–0.99) and with more cocaine injection (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.28–0.98). When equivalent changes in heroin were used as a covariate, the MMT effect on less cocaine use was hardly modified (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.07–2.65), and the effect on changes in cocaine injection disappeared. Conclusion: MMT enrollment is a protective factor against both cocaine use and injection among heroin users. The effect of MMT on cocaine injection appears to be mediated by heroin injection, whereas its effect on cocaine use is more direct. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The roles of two subtypes of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor in corticostriatal synaptic plasticity under cocaine withdrawal condition were examined in this study. Neither the resting membrane potential and input resistance of striatal neurons nor the long-term potentiation (LTP) of corticostriatal slices were affected by cocaine withdrawal. CRF dose-dependently enhanced in vitro corticostriatal LTP in rats from both cocaine-withdrawal and saline-control groups. Yet, the enhancement of corticostriatal LTP by CRF (20, 40, 80 nM) was significantly greater in the cocaine-withdrawal group than in the control group. CRF₁-selective antagonist (NBI 27914, 100 nM) attenuated the CRF-induced enhancement of corticostriatal LTP in both groups, whereas the CRF₂-selective antagonist (astression2B, 100 nM) attenuated the enhanced corticostriatal LTP only in the cocaine-withdrawal group. Importantly, urocortin2 (a CRF₂-selective agonist, 40 nM) selectively increased corticostriatal LTP in the cocaine-withdrawal group, but not in the saline controls. The urocortin2-induced enhancement of LTP was totally blocked by astression2B (100 nM). These results suggest that the CRF system modulate neuroadaptive changes in the corticostriatal circuit during cocaine withdrawal, and the CRF₂ in this area mediate an important mechanism that contributes to the relapse of cocaine addiction.

AB  - Background: Rats with extended daily cocaine access show escalating cocaine self-administration and behavioral signs of dependence. Regulation of glutamatergic transmission by metabotropic glutamate receptors has emerged as a mechanism in the addictive actions of drugs of abuse. We examined here whether neuroadaptive dysregulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor function is a factor in escalating cocaine self-administration. Methods: Rats with 1 hour daily cocaine access (short access [ShA]) versus 6-hour access (long access [LgA]) were tested for differences in the effects of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonist (-)-2-oxa-4-aminobicylco(3.1.0)hexane-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (LY379268) and the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonist 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]-pyridine (MTEP) on cocaine-reinforced progressive-ratio responding and differences in expression levels and functional activity of mGluR2/3 and mGluR5. Results: The LgA groups showed higher progressive-ratio breakpoints than ShA groups. LY379268 (0–3 mg/kg subcutaneous) dose-dependently lowered breakpoints in the LgA group but reduced breakpoints only at 3 mg/kg in the ShA group. Consistent with this behavioral effect, functional mGluR2/3 activity was significantly elevated following LgA cocaine exposure. MTEP (0–3 mg/kg intraperitoneal) reduced breakpoints in the ShA group only. Long access cocaine exposure was associated with decreased mGluR5 expression, accompanied by reduced functional mGluR5 activity in the nucleus accumbens. Adownward trend developed in mGluR5 protein expression in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Conclusions: Functional upregulation of mGluR2/3 and downregulation of mGluR5 are likely factors in the transition to cocaine dependence. The differential behavioral effects of LY379268 and MTEP in rats with a history of long access to cocaine have implications for the treatment target potential of mGluR2/3 and mGluR5.

AB  - Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced-behaviour is poorly understood. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms. Therefore NFκB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats. NFκB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats, as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased. Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFκB activity in the frontal cortex. In contrast, learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase. These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFκB in the alterations induced by cocaine. Topiramate prevented all the alterations observed, showing novel neuroprotective properties. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Brain-specific neural-zinc-finger transcription factor-2b (NZF2b/7ZFMyt1) is induced in the mesolimbic dopaminergic region after chronic cocaine exposure and lentiviral-mediated expression of NZF2b/7ZFMyt1 in the nucleus accumbens results in decreased locomotor activity (Chandrasekar and Dreyer, 2010). In this study the role of NZF2b/7ZFMyt1 in active cocaine seeking and of its interaction with histone deacetylase on the altered behavior has been observed. Localized expression of NZF2b/7ZFMyt1 in the nucleus accumbens resulted in attenuated cocaine self-administration, whereas silencing this transcription factor with lentiviruses expressing siRNAs increased the animal′s motivation to self-infuse cocaine. Low doses of sodium butyrate, a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase, were sufficient to reverse the NZF2b/7ZFMyt1-mediated decrease in cocaine self-administration. NZF2b/7ZFMyt1 expression resulted in strong induction of transcription factors REST1 and NAC1 and of the dopamine D2 receptor, with concomitant inhibition of BDNF and its receptor TrkB. We show that NZF2b/7ZFMyt1 colocalizes with histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2), probably overcoming the suppression of transcriptional activity caused by Lingo1. These findings show that molecular adaptations mediated by NZF2b/7ZFMyt1 expression possibly lead to decreased responsiveness to the reinforcing properties of cocaine and play a prominent role in affecting the behavioral changes induced by the drug.

AB  - Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the amygdala is involved in stress responses. Moreover, dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain reward system including the amygdala plays a significant role in the pathology of cocaine addiction. The present study analysed CRF-induced synaptic plasticity, its pharmacological sensitivity and interactions with the dopamine (DA) system in the basolateral to lateral capsula central amygdala (lcCeA) pathway after a 2-week withdrawal from repeated cocaine administration. A physiologically relevant CRF concentration (25 nm) induced long-term potentiation (LTP) that was enhanced after cocaine withdrawal. In saline-treated rats, CRF-induced LTP was mediated through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs) and CRF₁ receptors. However, in cocaine-withdrawn animals, activation of CRF₁ and CRF₂ receptors was found to enhance LTP. This enhanced CRF-induced LTP after cocaine withdrawal was mediated through endogenous activation of both D1- and D2-like receptors. Furthermore, expression of the D1 receptor (D1R) but not the D2R, D3R, D4R or D5R was significantly increased after cocaine withdrawal. CRF₁ but not CRF₂ protein expression was increased, suggesting that elevated levels of these proteins contributed to the enhancement of CRF-induced LTP during cocaine withdrawal. CRF interactions with the DA system in the amygdala may represent a fundamental neurochemical and cellular mechanism linking stress to cocaine-induced neuronal plasticity.

AB  - The effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on cocaine-seeking are brain region-specific. Infusion of BDNF into subcortical structures, like the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area, enhances cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization and cocaine-seeking. Conversely, repeated administration of BDNF antiserum into the nucleus accumbens during chronic cocaine self-administration attenuates cocaine-induced reinstatement. In contrast, BDNF infusion into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex immediately following a final session of cocaine self-administration attenuates relapse to cocaine-seeking after abstinence, as well as cue- and cocaine prime-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking following extinction. BDNF-induced alterations in the ERK–MAP kinase cascade and in prefronto-accumbens glutamatergic transmission are implicated in BDNF's ability to alter cocaine-seeking. Within 22 hours after infusion into the prefrontal cortex, BDNF increases BDNF protein in prefrontal cortical targets, including nucleus accumbens, and restores cocaine-mediated decreases in phospho-ERK expression in the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, 3 weeks after BDNF infusion in animals with a cocaine self-administration history, suppressed basal levels of glutamate are normalized and a cocaine prime-induced increase in extracellular glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens is prevented. Thus, BDNF may have local effects at the site of infusion and distal effects in target areas that are critical to mediating or preventing cocaine-induced dysfunctional neuroadaptations.

AB  - Cocaine exhibits high liability for inducing addictive behaviors, but the mechanisms of neuroplasticity underlying the behavioral effects remain unclear. As a crucial mediator of neuroplasticity in diverse functional models, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could contribute to the mechanisms of addiction-related neuroplasticity. Here, we addressed the hypothesis that cocaine increases synaptic dopamine, which induces BDNF protein expression to initiate addiction-related behavior in the rat. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure BDNF protein expression in rat striatal tissues. For behavioral readout, we used a noninvasive measurement system to measure the emission of 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalization (USV), a response that correlates with electrical brain stimulation and conditioned place preference behavior in rodents. A single injection of cocaine significantly increased BDNF protein expression, but this effect was not further augmented by repeated cocaine administration. A single administration of cocaine elicited significant and dose-related USV responses, and the magnitude of the behavior increased with repeated drug administration. R-(+)-7-Chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (SCH23390), but not raclopride, significantly attenuated cocaine-induced BDNF protein expression, whereas either the D₁-like or D₂-like receptor antagonist blocked cocaine-induced USV behavior. Furthermore, significant USV behavior was elicited by the nonselective dopamine agonist, apomorphine, but not by agonists that are selective for D₁-like or D₂-like receptors. Intracerebroventricular injection of the neurotrophin TrkB receptor inhibitor, K252a, blocked cocaine-induced USV behavior but not locomotor activity. These results suggest that neurotrophin signaling downstream of dopamine receptor function probably constitutes a crucial link in cocaine induction of USV behavior and may contribute to the mechanisms underlying the development of addiction-related behaviors.

AB  - We investigated whether the rs6265 (Val66Met SNP) is associated with response to ketamine in patients experiencing a major depressive episode. Homozygous Met carriers are rare in some human populations (<5%), thus our aim was to compare homozygous Val/Val individuals, who account for approximately 60% of the European-ancestry population [HapMap], against Met carriers (both Val/Met and Met/Met). We hypothesized that patients carrying a BDNF Met substitution would show an attenuated antidepressant response to ketamine infusion compared with Val/Val patients. The investigation was approved by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and Yale Institutional Review Boards and ethics committees. All subjects provided written informed consent. Our results suggest that major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with the Val/Val BDNF allele at rs6265 are more likely to exhibit increased antidepressant response to ketamine than Met carriers. Limitations of the study include small sample size and our inability to correct for population stratification. The results await replication.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the possible role that smoking crack cocaine has on the incidence of HIV infection. Given the increasing use of crack cocaine, we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for HIV infection. Methods: We included data from people participating in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study who reported injecting illicit drugs at least once in the month before enrolment, lived in the greater Vancouver area, were HIV-negative at enrolment and completed at least 1 follow-up study visit. To determine whether the risk of HIV seroconversion among daily smokers of crack cocaine changed over time, we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods: May 1, 1996–Nov. 30, 1999 (period 1), Dec. 1, 1999–Nov. 30, 2002 (period 2), and Dec. 1, 2002–Dec. 30, 2005 (period 3). Results: Overall, 1048 eligible injection drug users were included in our study. Of these, 137 acquired HIV infection during follow-up. The mean proportion of participants who reported daily smoking of crack cocaine increased from 11.6% in period 1 to 39.7% in period 3. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the risk of HIV seroconversion among participants who were daily smokers of crack cocaine increased over time (period 1: hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57–1.85; period 2: HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01–2.80; and period 3: HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.06–7.11). Interpretation: Smoking of crack cocaine was found to be an independent risk factor for HIV seroconversion among people who were injection drug users. This finding points to the urgent need for evidence-based public health initiatives targeted at people who smoke crack cocaine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Ras-ERK) signaling is central to the molecular machinery underlying cognitive functions. In the striatum, ERK1/2 kinases are co-activated by glutamate and dopamine D1/5 receptors, but the mechanisms providing such signaling integration are still unknown. The Ras-guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (Ras-GRF1), a neuronal specific activator of Ras-ERK signaling, is a likely candidate for coupling these neurotransmitter signals to ERK kinases in the striatonigral medium spiny neurons (MSN) and for modulating behavioral responses to drug abuse such as cocaine. Methods: We used genetically modified mouse mutants for Ras-GRF1 as a source of primary MSN cultures and organotypic slices, to perform both immunoblot and immunofluorescence studies in response to glutamate and dopamine receptor agonists. Mice were also subjected to behavioral and immunohistochemical investigations upon treatment with cocaine. Results: Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to glutamate, dopamine D1 agonist, or both stimuli simultaneously is impaired in Ras-GRF1–deficient striatal cells and organotypic slices of the striatonigral MSN compartment. Consistently, behavioral responses to cocaine are also affected in mice deficient for Ras-GRF1 or overexpressing it. Both locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference are significantly attenuated in Ras-GRF1–deficient mice, whereas a robust facilitation is observed in overexpressing transgenic animals. Finally, we found corresponding changes in ERK1/2 activation and in accumulation of FosB/ΔFosB, a well-characterized marker for long-term responses to cocaine, in MSN from these animals. Conclusions: These results strongly implicate Ras-GRF1 in the integration of the two main neurotransmitter inputs to the striatum and in the maladaptive modulation of striatal networks in response to cocaine.

AB  - Previous research with rats and monkeys has shown that tolerance to behavioral effects of cocaine developed if the drug was administered before behavioral test sessions but not if it was administered after sessions, a finding known as contingent tolerance. In contrast, a recent experiment using pigeons found that they showed tolerance resulting from postsession drug administration (noncontingent tolerance). The 4 experiments reported in this article were conducted to examine that result more fully. Experiment 1 found that immediate presession administration of cocaine to pigeons reliably led to tolerance to effects on food-reinforced operant key pecking and that immediate postsession administration of cocaine also led to tolerance in half the subjects, those whose key pecking was not suppressed by postsession dosing. Experiment 2 showed that eating in the home cage under the effects of postsession cocaine was not necessary for tolerance to develop to effects of postsession cocaine and that the majority of subjects developed tolerance from postsession cocaine administration. Experiment 3 found that mere drug exposure in the home cage without exposure to an experimental session did not reliably produce tolerance during the behavioral session. Experiment 4 showed that tolerance from postsession cocaine administration could be observed even when daily dosing was discontinued during dose–response curve assessment. Therefore, the combined results showed that pigeons often developed tolerance to effects of cocaine during the behavioral session when cocaine was administered postsession and that this tolerance was not the result of feeding under effects of the drug.

AB  - Background: Ventral tegmental area (VTA) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) contributes to time-dependent increases in cue-induced cocaine seeking after withdrawal (incubation of cocaine craving). Here, we studied the role of glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in incubation of cocaine craving because, like BDNF, GDNF provides trophic support to midbrain dopamine neurons. Methods: We first trained rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine for 10 days (6 hours/d, cocaine injections were paired with a tone-light cue). We then manipulated VTA GDNF function and assessed cue-induced cocaine seeking in extinction tests after withdrawal from cocaine. Results: VTA injections of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector containing rat GDNF cDNA (5 × 10⁸ viral genomes) on withdrawal Day 1 increased cue-induced cocaine seeking on withdrawal days 11 and 31; this effect was not observed after VTA injections of an AAV viral vector containing red fluorescent protein (RFP). Additionally, VTA, but not substantial nigra (SN), GDNF injections (1.25 μg or 12.5 μg/side) immediately after the last cocaine self-administration session increased cue-induced drug seeking on withdrawal days 3 and 10; this effect was reversed by VTA injections of U0126, which inhibits the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Finally, interfering with VTA GDNF function by chronic delivery of anti-GDNF monoclonal neutralizing antibodies via minipumps (600 ng/side/d) during withdrawal Days 1–14 prevented the time-dependent increases in cue-induced cocaine seeking on withdrawal days 11 and 31. Conclusions: Our results indicate that during the first weeks of withdrawal from cocaine self-administration, GDNF-dependent neuroadaptations in midbrain VTA neurons play an important role in the development of incubation of cocaine craving.

AB  - Current concepts suggest that stress-induced release of neuromodulators such as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) can drive drug-dependent behaviors. Although previous drug exposure can enhance behavioral and neurochemical responses to stress, it is unclear how such drug exposure alters the CRF modulation of excitatory synapses onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, a key locus of drug- and stress-induced neuroadaptation. Here, we demonstrate that, after repeated cocaine exposure, the magnitude and duration of the CRF-induced potentiation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated neurotransmission was significantly increased compared with naive and saline-treated mice. Furthermore, CRF enhanced AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated transmission only in mice that were exposed to cocaine. Increased frequency of AMPAR-mediated spontaneous miniature EPSCs and the intracellular blockade of CRF potentiation of AMPAR-mediated transmission suggest both presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of CRF. Importantly, pharmacological experiments revealed that CRF receptor 1 and protein kinase A pathways were newly recruited after repeated cocaine for the enhancement of CRF-induced NMDAR potentiation and the appearance of AMPAR potentiation. Thus, enhanced CRF-induced potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission onto VTA dopamine neurons after cocaine preexposure is likely to produce an abnormal increase in dopamine release during stressful events and could augment activation of addictive behaviors in response to stress.

AB  - Background: Hypocretin (Hcrt), an arousal- and feeding-associated peptide, is expressed in lateral hypothalamic neurons that project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Intra-VTA Hcrt reinstates morphine-conditioned place preferences, and intracerebroventricular and intra-VTA corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) reinstate cocaine seeking. Each is presumed to act, at least in part, through actions local to the VTA. Here, we examined the possibility that VTA perfusion of Hcrt reinstates cocaine seeking and, if so, whether it does so through the VTA mechanism that is implicated in reinstatement by CRF. Methods: Rats were trained to lever-press for intravenous cocaine (2 weeks) and then underwent extinction training (saline substituted for cocaine: 3 weeks). Reinstatement behavior was tested and VTA dialysates were collected and assayed for glutamate or dopamine following footshock or perfusion of Hcrt or CRF, with or without Hcrt or CRF antagonists, into the VTA. Results: Ventral tegmental area perfusion of Hcrt-1 or footshock stress reinstated cocaine seeking and caused release of VTA glutamate and dopamine. The effects of Hcrt-1 were blocked by a selective Hcrt-1 antagonist, but not a CRF antagonist, and were not mimicked by Hcrt-2. The Hcrt-1 antagonist did not block CRF-dependent footshock-induced reinstatement or glutamate or dopamine release. The behavioral and neurochemical effects of Hcrt-1 were attenuated but not blocked by kynurenic acid, an ionotropic glutamate antagonist that blocks footshock-induced reinstatement and glutamate release. Conclusions: While Hcrt and CRF are known to interact in some area of the brain, in the VTA proper they appear to have largely independent actions on the mesolimbic dopamine mechanisms of cocaine seeking.

AB  - We previously showed that betaxolol, a selective β₁-adrenergic receptor antagonist, administered during early phases of cocaine abstinence, ameliorated withdrawal-induced anxiety and blocked increases in amygdalar β₁-adrenergic receptor expression in rats. Here, we report the efficacy of betaxolol in reducing increases in gene expression of amygdalar corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a peptide known to be involved in mediating ‘anxiety-like’ behaviors during initial phases of cocaine abstinence. We also demonstrate attenuation of an amygdalar β₁-adrenergic receptor-mediated cell-signaling pathway following this treatment. Male rats were administered betaxolol at 24 and 44 h following chronic cocaine administration. Animals were euthanized at the 48-h time point and the amygdala was microdissected and processed for quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and/or western blot analysis. Results showed that betaxolol treatment during early cocaine withdrawal attenuated increases in amygdalar CRF gene expression and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase regulatory and catalytic subunit (nuclear fraction) protein expression. Our data also reveal that β₁-adrenergic receptors are on amygdalar neurons, which are immunoreactive for CRF. The present findings suggest that the efficacy of betaxolol treatment on cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety may be related, in part, to its effect on amygdalar β₁-adrenergic receptor, modulation of its downstream cell-signaling elements and CRF gene expression.

AB  - Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a recently discovered neuropeptide that increases arousal and wakefulness while decreasing anxiety-like behavior. Here, we used a self-administration paradigm to demonstrate that intracerebroventricular infusion of NPS reinstates extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior in a dose-dependent manner in mice. The highest dose of NPS (0.45 nM) increased active lever pressing in the absence of cocaine to levels that were equivalent to those observed during self-administration. In addition, we examined the role of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF₁) in this behavior as well as locomotor stimulation and anxiolysis. CRF₁ knock-out mice did not respond to either the locomotor stimulant or cocaine reinstatement effects of NPS, but still responded to its anxiolytic effect. The CRF₁ antagonist antalarmin also blocked the increase in active lever responding in the reinstatement model and the locomotor activating properties of NPS without affecting its anxiolytic actions. Our results suggest that NPS receptors may be an important target for drug abuse research and treatment and that CRF₁ mediates the cocaine-seeking and locomotor stimulant effects of NPS, but not its effects on anxiety-like behavior.

AB  - Although chronic cocaine-induced changes in dendritic spines on nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons have been correlated with behavioral sensitization, the molecular pathways governing these structural changes, and their resulting behavioral effects, are poorly understood. The transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NFκB), is rapidly activated by diverse stimuli and regulates expression of many genes known to maintain cell structure. Therefore, we evaluated the role of NFκB in regulating cocaine-induced dendritic spine changes on medium spiny neurons of the NAc and the rewarding effects of cocaine. We show that chronic cocaine induces NFκB-dependent transcription in the NAc of NFκB-Lac transgenic mice. This induction of NFκB activity is accompanied by increased expression of several NFκB genes, the promoters of which show chromatin modifications after chronic cocaine exposure consistent with their transcriptional activation. To study the functional significance of this induction, we used viral-mediated gene transfer to express either a constitutively active or dominant-negative mutant of Inhibitor of κB kinase (IKKca or IKKdn), which normally activates NFκB signaling, in the NAc. We found that activation of NFκB by IKKca increases the number of dendritic spines on NAc neurons, whereas inhibition of NFκB by IKKdn decreases basal dendritic spine number and blocks the increase in dendritic spines after chronic cocaine. Moreover, inhibition of NFκB blocks the rewarding effects of cocaine and the ability of previous cocaine exposure to increase an animal’s preference for cocaine. Together, these studies establish a direct role for NFκB pathways in the NAc to regulate structural and behavioral plasticity to cocaine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rationale: Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and noradrenaline (NA) have been shown in independent studies to mediate stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. To date, however, a functional interaction between the systems in reinstatement has not been demonstrated. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine whether CRF and NA systems can interact to influence reinstatement responding and, if so, in what direction the interaction occurs. Materials and methods: Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.23 mg/kg per infusion) for 8-10 days. Subsequently, responding for drug was extinguished, and tests for reinstatement were conducted following: (1) pretreatment with the CRF receptor antagonist, D-Phe CRF12-41 [1 μg, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)], prior to i.c.v. injections of NA (10 μg; Experiment 1); (2) pretreatment with the alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (40 μg/kg, i.p.), prior to i.c.v. injections of CRF (0.5 μg; Experiment 2); (3) pretreatment with D-Phe (1, 5 μg, i.c.v.), prior to systemic injections of the alpha(2) adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (1.25 mg/kg; Experiment 3A); or (4) pretreatment with clonidine (40 μg/kg, i.p.) prior to systemic injections of yohimbine (0.625 mg/kg, 1.25 mg/kg; Experiment 3B). Results: NA reliably induced reinstatement, an effect that was blocked by pretreatment with D-Phe. In contrast, CRF-induced reinstatement was not attenuated by pretreatment with clonidine. Pretreatment with neither D-Phe nor clonidine was effective in blocking yohimbine-induced reinstatement. Conclusion: Together, the present findings suggest a functional interaction between NA and CRF systems in mediating stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, whereby activation of CRF receptors occurs subsequent to, and downstream of, the sites of action of NA.

AB  - Cocaine is a worldwide used drug and its abuse is associated with physical, psychiatric and social problems. The mechanism by which cocaine causes neurological damage is very complex and involves several neurotransmitter systems. For example, cocaine increases extracellular levels of dopamine and free radicals, and modulates several transcription factors. NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression involved in cellular death. Our aim was to investigate the toxicity and modulation of NF-κB activity by cocaine in PC12 cells. Treatment with cocaine (1 mM) for 24 hours induced DNA fragmentation, cellular membrane rupture and reduction of mitochondrial activity. A decrease in Bcl-2 protein and mRNA levels, and an increase in caspase 3 activity and cleavage were also observed. In addition, cocaine (after 6 hours treatment) activated the p50/p65 subunit of NF-κB complex and the pretreatment of the cells with SCH 23390, a D1 receptor antagonist, attenuated the NF-κB activation. Inhibition of NF-κB activity by using PDTC and Sodium Salicilate increased cell death caused by cocaine. These results suggest that cocaine induces cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) and activates NF-κB in PC12 cells. This activation occurs, at least partially, due to activation of D1 receptors and seems to have an anti-apoptotic effect on these cells. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Few studies have examined factors associated with depressive symptoms in crack cocaine smokers, although cocaine use has been linked to depression. The purpose of this study was to identify correlates of depressive symptoms in a sample of 799 HIV-positive and HIV-seronegative African-American crack cocaine smokers. Multiple regression modelling revealed that anxiety was strongly and positively associated with depressive symptoms. In addition, being female and more frequent crack smoking were also found to be associated. Higher self-esteem and decision-making confidence were found to be associated with less often experiencing depressive symptoms. The model accounted for 64% of the variance in the data. It was noteworthy that HIV infection, as such, was not associated with depressive symptoms. The study has important implication for mental health and health promotion interventions targeting crack cocaine smokers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To explore empirically the presence of certain certain factors as risk elements for cocaine consumption. Method: Analysis of the data obtained in a set of items that measure the variables of Planned Behavior Theory (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and behavioral intention) in three groups: Group A is made up of 192 cocaine users without treatment, Group B comprises 110 cocaine users in treatment, and Group C is made up of 100 individuals who had never used cocaine. Results: Group A scored significantly higher in all the variables, while Group C was which obtained the lowest scores. Group B showed no significant differences from Group A in the subjective norm variable, nor from Group C in the perceived behavioral control and behavioral intention variables. Discussion: This study highlights the importance of attitudes and subjective norm in the explanation of current cocaine use, but especially the function of perceived behavioral control as a risk factor that should be taken into account in the design of preventive strategies.

AB  - Background: Identifying treatments that produce specific benefits in non drug psychosocial functioning areas such as employment functioning has been illusive. Examination of dimensions of clinical status that moderate such effects may be useful in planning more effective interventions. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine if life stress and four dimensions of personality and psychopathology previously found to predict early post-treatment relapse in diverse groups of substance abusers, predict less recovery in employment functioning among 240 cocaine dependent males after completion of residential treatment. Methods: Latent growth curve analysis was used to determine if antisocial, avoidant, dependent, paranoid-delusional personality dimensions, and life event stress predict employment problem severity evident at drug treatment discharge and change in employment problems over three 3-month follow-up intervals. Results: Individuals with higher employment severity at intake and those who spent less time in treatment tended to have greater employment problems at the pre discharge. Two covariates were significant predictors of the linear growth component, and the set of covariates explained approximately 18% of the variation in the linear growth rates. Individuals with higher paranoid/delusional scores and lower educational attainment experienced less improvement in their employment status over follow-up. Conclusions: Current findings appear consistent with those of McLellan and colleagues who found that greater psychiatric severity predicts poor response to treatment across multiple psychosocial outcomes including employment status. Clinical Significance: More intensive and long-term psychiatric treatment and vocational-educational rehabilitative services may be required for improvement in employment functioning among those with relatively severe psychopathology.

AB  - Prenatal cocaine exposure and the role of gender were evaluated using risk factor analyses to determine whether 6-month-old cocaine-exposed male infants demonstrated greater disruptions in infant–caregiver socioemotional interactions during a Still-Face test. Overall, non–cocaine-exposed infants spent more time looking at toys, compared with cocaine-exposed infants; nonexposed female infants spent more time scanning the environment, compared with nonexposed male infants. When caregiver behavior during the Still-Face was evaluated, differences emerged in amount of time the caregiver spent vocalizing to the infant. She vocalized more to a cocaine-exposed infant compared with a nonexposed one; she reduced vocalizing more during the test if the cocaine-exposed infant was female. An exposure by gender interaction emerged in the amount of change in caregiver vocalizations; however, the overarching hypothesis that male cocaine-exposed infants are at higher risk than nonexposed male, nonexposed female, and cocaine-exposed female infants was not supported. Because this interaction was evident in this cohort at 24 months, future research is needed to determine at what age an interaction begins to emerge in this cohort.

This is a survey of a representative sample drawn from cities in different geographical regions in Turkey in 1998 and 2001. The questionnaire was administered to 18,556 and 11,911 l0th-grade students in 1998 and 2001, respectively. The questionnaire administered in the study was adapted from the questionnaires used in 'Monitoring the Future' study in the United States and ESPAD (the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs). It included questions about demographic characteristics, family characteristics, school life, social contacts and use of substances. While the percentage of those who used Ecstasy at least once in their life-times was 2.65% in 1998, the figure reached 3.31% in 2001. Male gender, older age, use of alcohol, cannabis, heroin and cocaine, non-medical use of psychotherapeutic drugs and participation in a meeting concerning the adverse effects of substance use were found to be significant variables predicting 'ever use' of Ecstasy in both years by logistic regression analysis. Ecstasy use, while low in Turkey, appears to be on the increase and follows a pattern in terms of correlates that is similar to other illicit drugs.

AB  - Aim: To analyse drug consumption patterns and demographic and medical factors associated with health-related quality of life (HRQL) in a nonclinical sample of regular cocaine consumers. Methods: Face-to-face interviews with 687 young regular cocaine users (aged 18-30 years) in three Spanish cities: Barcelona, Madrid and Seville. HRQL was measured using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and degree of dependence through the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS). Bivariate analyses were conducted using nonparametric techniques, and a Tobit regression analysis was carried out to determine which variables best explained HRQL. Results: Most participants showed a good HRQL, but differences in HRQL were found for sociodemographic (gender), medical (days stayed in bed during the previous 12 months) and consumption-pattern related variables (length of drug use, intravenous drug use, crack use, SDS). In multivariate analyses cocaine dependence measured by SDS explained the greatest amount of HRQL variation. Although women declared worse HRQL (13.6 versus 9.7, P < 0.01), in the final model with interactions no gender differences were observed, except that HRQL for women worsened with the number of days they had stayed in bed in the previous 12 months. Conclusions: Even in early phases of dependence, deterioration in HRQL is observed, mainly related to drug-use history and patterns. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Patients living with human immunodeficiency virus represent a growing population, and an increased number of central nervous system presentations can be expected over the next decade. Emerging data suggests that both HIV-seropositive patients and cocaine-abusing patients may be at special risk of seizure phenomena. This case report discusses the risks of new-onset seizure activity when these two risk factors converge, which is a common occurrence in this population. Data from the fields of neuroanatomy and neurovirology are presented to explain the heightened risk of this patient population and provide the practitioner with an improved understanding of the central nervous system complexities in HIV.

AB  - Objective: One objective was to determine if cocaine-using women who did not maintain infant custody (NMC) would report more psychological distress, domestic violence, negative coping skills, lower social support and more childhood trauma than cocaine-using women who maintained custody (MC) of their infant. A second objective was to evaluate the relative contribution of psychosocial factors to infant placement. Methods: Psychosocial profiles of MC women (n = 144) were compared with NMC (n = 66) cocaine-using women. Subjects were low income, urban, African-American women who delivered an infant at a county teaching hospital. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), an assessment of coping strategies (COPE), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were administered. The associations of infant placement status to demographic factors, drug use and psychosocial measures were evaluated. Results: The NMC group reported greater overall psychological distress, psychoticism, somatization, anxiety and hostility than the MC group. The NMC group had more childhood neglect and physical abuse and used more negative coping strategies than the MC group. Lack of prenatal care [OR = .83, CI (.75-.91), p < .0001], heavier prenatal cocaine use [OR = 2.55, CI (1.13-4.34), p < .007], greater psychological distress [OR = 2.21, CI (1.13-4.34), p < .02] and a childhood history of emotional neglect [OR = 1.10, CI (1.02-1.19), p < .02] were associated with increased likelihood of loss of infant custody after control for other substance use and demographic variables. Conclusions: NMC women have more negative psychological and behavioral functioning post-partum than MC women. Less prenatal care and greater cocaine use, psychological distress and maternal childhood emotional neglect are associated with the post-partum placement of infants born to cocaine-using women. Practice Implications: Results of this study indicate that poor, urban women who use cocaine prenatally display several measurable differences on psychosocial and behavioral risk factors based on child placement status. Among these risk factors heavier cocaine use, lack of prenatal care, more severe psychological symptoms and early childhood experiences of emotional neglect increase the likelihood of loss of infant custody. Routine, objective assessments of psychosocial and behavioral characteristics of women who use cocaine during pregnancy can aid Child Protective Service workers and clinicians by providing baseline data from which to tailor interventions and set improvement criteria for mother-child reunification.

AB  - Rationale: Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), a protein involved in survival and maintenance of several cell phenotypes as well as in synaptic plasticity, is modulated by stress (Molteni et al., Brain Res Rev 37:249-258, 2001; Fumagalli et al., Neurobiol Dis 20:731-737, 2005) and cocaine (Fumagalli et al., J Neurochem 96:996-1004, 2006). Objectives: Since it is widely recognized that stress influences drug seeking, we decided to investigate whether stress, acute or repeated, could influence the changes in FGF-2 gene expression brought about by cocaine. Results: Our data demonstrate that stress and cocaine interact to produce significant changes on FGF-2 expression in rat prefrontal cortex and striatum. In prefrontal cortex, our experiments demonstrated that a single exposure to stress potentiated cocaine-induced FGF-2 elevation, whereas prolonged stress prevented the modulation of the trophic factor in response to cocaine. In striatum, the magnitude of cocaine-induced FGF-2 response is enhanced by repeated stress, whereas no interaction was observed when acute stress and single exposure to cocaine were combined. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that stress interacts with cocaine to alter the pattern of FGF-2 expression in a way that depends on whether stress is acute or chronic and in a regionally selective fashion. These results identify a potential molecular target through which stress alters cellular sensitivity to cocaine and might prove useful in understanding the mechanisms underlying brain vulnerability to stress.

AB  - Basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons provide a major excitatory input to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-layer V pyramidal neurons. Under stressful conditions, commonly associated with chronic cocaine abuse, altered BLA-to-mPFC synaptic transmission could lead to defective emotional information processing and decision making within the mPFC and result in misguided and inappropriate behaviors. We examined the effects of cocaine administered chronically in vivo on EPSCs recorded from a putative BLA-mPFC pathway in vitro and their modulation by dopamine (DA), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and their combination (DA plus CRF). In saline-treated animals, activation of D1/5 receptors depressed BLA-mPFC EPSCs, whereas CRF₁ receptor activation alone had no effect on EPSCs. Activating D1/5 and CRF₁ receptors in combination, however, worked synergistically through presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms to depress EPSCs to levels greater than D1/5 receptor activation alone. After chronic cocaine administration, the function of DA(1/5) and CRF receptors switched from inhibitory to excitatory. In slices from cocaine-treated animals, putative BLA-mPFC EPSCs were depressed through a presynaptic mechanism. Now, activation of either D1/5 or CRF₂ receptors increased the cocaine-induced, depressed EPSCs. Additionally, simultaneous activation of presynaptic D1/5 and CRF₂ receptors led to further enhancement of EPSCs. These data indicate that CRF acting synergistically with DA normally potentiates D1/5-induced synaptic depression. However, after chronic cocaine, the combined synergistic actions of DA and CRF switched polarity to enhance facilitation of BLA-mPFC glutamatergic transmission. Also unmasked after acute withdrawal from chronic cocaine are endogenous, tonic-inhibitory D2-like and tonic-facilitatory CRF₂ receptor actions. These multiple functional and receptor changes may underlie the altered, possibly aberrant, decision-making process after chronic cocaine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rationale: Stressful events during periods of drug abstinence likely contribute to relapse in cocaine-dependent individuals. Excessive cocaine use may increase susceptibility to stressor-induced relapse through alterations in brain corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) responsiveness. Objectives: This study examined stressor- and CRF-induced cocaine seeking and other stress-related behaviors in rats with different histories of cocaine self-administration (SA). Materials and Methods: Rats self-administered cocaine under short-access (ShA; 2 h daily) or long-access (LgA; 6 h daily) conditions for 14 days or were provided access to saline and were tested for reinstatement by a stressor (electric footshock), cocaine or an icv injection of CRF and for behavioral responsiveness on the elevated plus maze, in a novel environment and in the light-dark box after a 14- to 17-day extinction/withdrawal period. Results: LgA rats showed escalating patterns of cocaine SA and were more susceptible to reinstatement by cocaine, EFS, or icv CRF than ShA rats. Overall, cocaine SA increased activity in the center field of a novel environment, on the open arms of the elevated plus maze, and in the light compartment of a light-dark box. In most cases, the effects of cocaine SA were dependent on the pattern/amount of cocaine intake with statistically significant differences from saline self-administering controls only observed in LgA rats. Conclusions: When examined after several weeks of extinction/withdrawal, cocaine SA promotes a more active pattern of behavior during times of stress that is associated with a heightened susceptibility to stressor-induced cocaine-seeking behavior and may be the consequence of augmented CRF regulation of addiction-related neurocircuitry.

AB  - Growing concerns surround the risk of fetal exposure to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy). Prior animal studies using neonatal rats administered MDMA from postnatal days (P) 11-20 (a period approximating third trimester brain development in humans) have demonstrated long-lasting decrements in serotonin (5-HT) and learning; however, no studies have examined the acute post- MDMA response of the brain at this early age. Specifically, it is of interest whether MDMA administration to neonatal rats produces the expected depletion of monoamines and whether the brain exhibits any ameliorative response to the pharmacologic insult. In the current study, this model was employed to determine whether forebrain and brainstem dopamine (DA) and 5-HT neurochemistry were altered 24 h after the last injection (P21), and whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was upregulated in response to MDMA exposure. All forebrain structures examined (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum) showed significant MDMA-induced reductions in 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-HIAA, and significant increases in the DA metabolite, HVA, as well as DA turnover (HVA/DA). In the brainstem, there were significant increases in 5-HIAA, HVA and DA turnover. BDNF was significantly increased (19-38%) in all forebrain structures and in the brainstem in MDMA-exposed neonates versus saline controls. These data suggest that MDMA exposure to the developing rat brain from PI 1-20 produces similar alterations in serotonin and dopamine neurochemistry to those observed from adult administrations. In addition, a compensatory increase in BDNF was observed and may be the brains ameliorative response to minimize MDMA effects. This is the first report demonstrating that MDMA exposure results in increased levels of BDNF and that such increases are correlated with changes in monoamine levels. Future research is needed to elucidate any deleterious effects MDMA-induced increases in trophic activity might have on the developing brain and to examine earlier gestational exposure periods in order to assess the risk throughout pregnancy.

AB  - Chronic cocaine and heroin users display a variety of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunctions including impaired attention, learning, memory, reaction time, cognitive flexibility, impulse control and selective processing. These findings suggest that these drugs may alter normal brain functions and possibly cause neurotoxicity. Neurotrophins are a class of proteins that serve as survival factors for CNS neurons. In particular, nerve growth factor (NGF) plays an important role in the survival and function of cholinergic neurons while brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in synaptic plasticity and in the maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. In the present study, we measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the NGF and BDNF levels in serum of three groups of subjects: heroin-dependent patients, cocaine-dependent patients and healthy volunteers. Our goal was to identify possible change in serum neurotrophins in heroin and cocaine users. BDNF was decreased in heroin users whereas NGF was decreased in both heroin and cocaine users. These findings indicate that NGF and BDNF may play a role in the neurotoxicity and addiction induced by these drugs. In view of the neurotrophin hypothesis of schizophrenia the data also suggest that reduced level of neurotrophins may increase the risk of developing psychosis in drug users.

AB  - Context: Although genetic risk factors have been found to contribute to dependence on both licit and illicit psychoactive substances, we know little of how these risk factors interrelate. Objective: To clarify the structure of genetic and environmental risk factors for symptoms of dependence on cannabis, cocaine, alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine in males and females. Design: Lifetime history by structured clinical interview. Setting: General community. Participants: Four thousand eight hundred sixty-five members of male-male and female-female pairs from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders. Main Outcome Measure: Lifetime symptoms of abuse of and dependence on cannabis, cocaine, alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. Results: Controlling for greater symptom prevalence in males, genetic and environmental parameters could be equated across sexes. Two models explained the data well. The best-fit exploratory model contained 2 genetic factors and 1 individual environmental factor contributing to all substances. The first genetic factor loaded strongly on cocaine and cannabis dependence; the second, on alcohol and nicotine dependence. Nicotine and caffeine had high substance-specific genetic effects. A confirmatory model, which also fit well, contained 1 illicit drug genetic factor--loading only on cannabis and cocaine--and 1 licit drug genetic factor loading on alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. However, these factors were highly intercorrelated (r = + 0.82). Large substance-specific genetic effects remained for nicotine and caffeine. Conclusions: The pattern of genetic and environmental risk factors for psychoactive substance dependence was similar in males and females. Genetic risk factors for dependence on common psychoactive substances cannot be explained by a single factor. Rather, 2 genetic factors--one predisposing largely to illicit drug dependence, the other primarily to licit drug dependence--are needed. Furthermore, a large proportion of the genetic influences on nicotine and particularly caffeine dependence appear to be specific to those substances.

AB  - Cocaine addiction is one of the severest health problems faced by western countries, where there is an increasing prevalence of lifelong abuse. The most challenging aspects in the treatment of cocaine addiction are craving and relapse, especially in view of the fact that, at present, there is a lack of effective pharmacological treatment for the disorder. What is required are new pharmacological approaches based on our current understanding of the neurobiological bases of drug addiction. Within the context of the behavioral and neurochemical actions of cocaine, this paper considers the contribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its main intracellular signaling mechanisms, including mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), in psychostimulant addiction. Repeated cocaine administration leads to an increase in BDNF levels and enhanced activity in the intracellular pathways (PI3K and MAPK/ERK) in the reward-related brain areas, which applies especially several days following withdrawal. It has been hypothesized that these neurochemical changes contribute to the enduring synaptic plasticity that underlies sensitized responses to psychostimulants and drug-conditioned memories leading to compulsive drug use and frequent relapse after withdrawal. Nevertheless, increased BDNF levels could also have a role as a protection factor in addiction. The inhibition of the intracellular pathways, ERK and PI3K, leads to a disruption in sensitized responses and conditioned memories associated with cocaine addiction and suggests new, potential therapeutic strategies to explore in the dependence on psychostimulants.

AB  - Studies have investigated the potential effects of prenatal cocaine exposure (CE) on children's development. However, few studies have examined predictors of resilient outcomes in this population. We examined vagal tone (VT) as a resilience factor in prenatal CE. Utilizing data from the Maternal Lifestyle Study, a cumulative risk index was derived for children with and without prenatal CE. Presence of CE and other prenatal drugs was summed with postnatal risks in infancy to yield a 15-item risk index. Preschool cognitive outcomes, problem behaviors, and adaptive behaviors were measured. VT was assessed during an infant exam at I month and toy exploration at 36 months. We included children with complete physiologic data (217 CE, 333 non-CE). Children were classified as having consistently high, consistently low, or fluctuating VT at 1 and 36 months. Children were also classified as high versus low risk. High-risk children had lower IQ scores, more problem behaviors, and lower ratings of adaptive behaviors than low-risk children. A significant risk by VT-stability interaction indicated that for high-risk children, those with stable low VT had higher ratings of adaptive behaviors at 36 months. This is consistent with theory linking reduced VT during tasks to adaptive regulation and indicates that such regulatory functioning may serve as a protective factor in prenatal CE.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to do an exploratory factor analysis and to examine the criterion-related and discriminant validity of the Lifetime Severity Index for Cocaine (LSI-C), Spanish version. A sample of 171 outpatients from 10 drug centers in Spain participated in the study. We conducted the factor analysis with orthogonal rotation and examined correlations between the LSI-C total score and criterion variables as well as the score obtained by a quality of life measure. The factor analysis revealed 2 principal factors that explain 65.8% of the variance. Lower LSI-C scores were associated with taking medication, receiving social help, using cocaine fewer than 30 times during the previous 6 months, and with better scores on quality of life measures. Higher LSI-C scores were associated with unstable housing, overdose, hospitalization, cocaine consumption more than 100 times during the previous 6 months, and more years of drug consumption. The LSI-C Spanish version shows acceptable criterion-related and discriminant validity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aims: This paper explored, in a population-based sample of males, the factorial structure of criteria for substance abuse and dependence, and compared qualitatively the performance of these criteria across drug categories using item-response theory (IRT). Design: Marginal maximum likelihood was used to explore the factor structure of criteria within drug classes, and a two-parameter IRT model was used to determine how the difficulty and discrimination of individual criteria differ across drug classes. Participants: A total of 4234 males born from 1940 to 1974 from the population-based Virginia Twin Registry were approached to participate. Measurements: DSM-IV drug use, abuse and dependence criteria for cannabis, sedatives, stimulants, cocaine and opiates. Findings: For each drug class, the pattern of endorsement of individual criteria for abuse and dependence, conditioned on initiation and use, could be best explained by a single factor. There were large differences in individual item performance across substances in terms of item difficulty and discrimination. Cocaine users were more likely to have encountered legal, social, physical and psychological consequences. Conclusions: The DSM-IV abuse and dependence criteria, within each drug class, are not distinct but best described in terms of a single underlying continuum of risk. Because individual criteria performed very differently across substances in IRT analyses, the assumption that these items are measuring equivalent levels of severity or liability with the same discrimination across different substances is unsustainable. Compared to other drugs, cocaine usage is associated with more detrimental effects and negative consequences, whereas the effects of cannabis and hallucinogens appear to be less harmful. Implications for other drug classes are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Female inner-city substance users evidence greater crack/cocaine use and are more likely to be dependent on this drug than on any other drug. Additionally, female inner-city substance users evidence greater crack/cocaine use and are more likely to be dependent on this drug than their male counterparts, despite no consistent difference demonstrated in use and dependence across other drugs. Because no published work has empirically examined the factors underlying this link between females and crack/cocaine, the current study examined the role of theoretically relevant personality and environmental variables. Among 152 (37% female) individuals in a residential substance-use treatment program, females evidenced greater use of crack/cocaine (current and lifetime heaviest) and were significantly more likely to evidence crack/cocaine dependence than their male counterparts. In contrast, no gender differences were found for any other substance across alcohol, cannabis, and hallucinogens (including PCP). Surprisingly, females were more impulsive than their male counterparts, with impulsivity serving as a risk factor in the relationship between gender and crack/cocaine dependence and lifetime heaviest use. Females also evidenced higher levels of negative emotionality and childhood abuse, but neither variable served as a risk factor in the relationship between gender and crack/cocaine dependence or use. Limitations and future directions are discussed, including the need for further exploration of impulsivity across its various dimensions as well as the inclusion of additional variables such as social context variables to account more fully for this complex link between gender and crack/cocaine.

AB  - Objective: This study identifies self-reported factors facilitating initiation of cocaine and heroin among young problem users in Amsterdam to enable interventions to be targeted at issues personally relevant for this population. Method: A qualitative study using in-depth interviews to obtain retrospective drug use histories. Recruitment took place both directly (by street outreach, outreach at methadone outposts) and indirectly (by respondent-driven sampling). The study started in the year 2001 and included 50 problem drug users, aged 18-30, of whom 72% were male, 64% were polydrug users, and 36% were homeless. Results: The seven most common self-reported factors facilitating initiation of cocaine and heroin are desire for affect regulation, drug availability, curiosity, desire to be part of a group, misinformation, desire for energy, and starting because it has a depressant effect. Conclusion: Some factors perceived to facilitate initiation of cocaine and/or heroin revealed in this study are hardly addressed by current prevention programs and could inform future initiatives. Programs can be targeted at young people who we identified to be at high risk. Research using quantitative methods is likely to be valuable in determining the relative importance of mentioned factors for different groups of young people. The study's limitations are noted.

AB  - Objective: Cocaine-induced paranoia (CIP), an irrational intense suspicion of others, is a common manifestation of cocaine dependence. Both environmental and genetic factors are thought to play a role, but the specific nature of such contributions is poorly understood. Methods: Demographic, diagnostic, and cocaine-use data were obtained from 420 cocaine-dependent, genetically confirmed, full-sibling pairs (N= 840 subjects) interviewed with the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA). Probands with and without CIP were compared; then, factors associated with sibling CIP status were analyzed by logistic regression. Alcohol dependence, a known heritable phenotype, was analyzed as a positive control. Results: Of 420 probands, 273 (65%) experienced CIP. Probands with CIP were more severely dependent upon cocaine, had an earlier age of onset, were more likely to smoke cocaine, and used cocaine less frequently during the preceding year. Independent analyses of siblings replicated two of the former (i.e., dependence severity and age of onset). Probands with CIP also had a non-significantly higher proportion of siblings with the trait (66% versus 59%). Probands with concurrent alcohol dependence were confirmed to have significantly higher rates of alcoholism among their siblings. Conclusions: Severity of cocaine dependence and age of onset appear to be important risk factors for CIP. Concordance for CIP between siblings did not emerge as significant in our analyses.

AB  - Anxiety-like behaviors emerge with repeated exposure to and short-term withdrawal from cocaine. The stress-related neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), has been implicated in the anxiogenic effects of cocaine withdrawal, as well as in some of the long-lasting effects of cocaine. One objective of the present experiments was to determine whether repeated exposures to cocaine, under conditions that induce anxiety in the initial withdrawal period, would induce longer-lasting anxiogenic responses. A second objective was to determine whether any such effects would be potentiated by CRF. In Experiment 1, animals were injected once daily for 7 days with cocaine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline in the home cages and, after a 10-day drug-free period, were given an i.c.v. injection of CRF (0.5 or 5.0 μg) or vehicle, followed by a 5-min test for anxiety in the elevated plus maze or light-dark transition apparatus. In Experiment 2, animals were given the cocaine or saline injections in a distinct environment. At test, they were placed in the distinct environment after the CRF (0.5 μg) or vehicle injection and were subsequently tested for anxiety. Cocaine produced enhanced levels of anxiety when pre-exposures were given in a distinct environment, but not when they were given in the home cage. In neither case did cocaine differentially alter anxiety-like responses to CRF. The results suggest that a 'reminder' of the drug experience, such as re-exposure to cocaine-paired contextual cues, may be necessary to induce elevated levels of anxiety after the initial withdrawal period. In addition, although the results do not rule out a role for endogenous CRF in lasting cocaine-induced anxiogenic responses, they suggest that an increased sensitivity of CRF receptors to the peptide is not responsible for the effect.

AB  - Cocaine addiction is an enduring, relapsing, behavioural disorder in which stressors reinstate cocaine-seeking even after prolonged abstinence. Evidence suggests that the 'anxiety-like' behaviour and stress associated with protracted withdrawal may be mediated by increased corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a part of the limbic circuitry engaged in the coding and transmission of stimulus-reward associations. In the present study we describe a long-lasting potentiation of glutamatergic transmission induced at lateral amygdala (LA)-to-CeA synapses by rat/human CRF. After 2 weeks of withdrawal from repeated intermittent exposure to cocaine, CRF-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) was greatly enhanced compared to the respective saline control group while, after short-term withdrawal (24 h), there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups, indicating alterations in CRF systems during protracted withdrawal from chronic cocaine. After prolonged withdrawal, CRF-induced LTP was dependent on activation of CRF₂, CaV2.3 (R-type) calcium channels and intracellular signalling through protein kinase C in both saline- and cocaine-treated groups. The enhanced CRF-induced LTP after 2 weeks of withdrawal was mediated through augmented CRF₁ receptor function, associated with an increased signalling through protein kinase A, and required N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Accordingly, single-cell recordings revealed a significantly increased NMDA/AMPA ratio after prolonged withdrawal from the cocaine treatment. These results support a role for CRF₁ receptor antagonists as plausible treatment options during withdrawal from chronic cocaine and suggest CaV2.3 blockers as potential candidates for pharmaceutical modulation of CRF systems.

AB  - Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) has been implicated in a number of the behavioral and biochemical effects of cocaine. We recently reported that central injections of CRF produce a potentiated locomotor response in animals that had been given repeated injections of cocaine up to 4 weeks earlier. We now report that with as few as 1 or 3 exposures to cocaine (total of 45 mg/kg, i.p., per day), and a drug-free period of 28 days, i.c.v. injections of CRF (0.5 μg) produce augmented locomotor responses, similar to those induced by cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) itself. In addition, in animals pre-exposed to cocaine for 3 days, pre-treatment with the CRF receptor antagonist, D-Phe CRF12-41 (1 μg, i.c.v.), blocks the expression of behavioral sensitization to a cocaine challenge after a 28-day drug-free period. These results demonstrate that short-term exposure to cocaine produces a form of long-term sensitization within systems upon which CRF acts and that activation of CRF receptors is importantly involved in the expression of behavioral sensitization to cocaine.

AB  - The behavioral and neurobiological impact of cocaine can be strongly influenced by the environmental context in which the cocaine effects are experienced. In this report, we present the results of an experimental study in which the effects of environmental context in terms of novelty/familiarity upon locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine were examined. In the first phase of the study, two groups of naive rats (N = 10/group) received either cocaine (10 mg/kg) or saline immediately prior to a 20-min test in a novel open-field environment. After three daily cocaine/saline test sessions, both groups received a saline test to evaluate cocaine conditioned drug effects. In the second phase, two groups (N = 10/group) were administered a 20-min saline test 1 day prior to receiving the same cocaine and saline testing regimen as in the first phase. Cocaine sensitization effects were not observed when the cocaine treatments were initiated in a novel environment but were observed when the same cocaine treatments were preceded 1 day by a single 20-min test environment exposure. The maximal locomotion sensitization effects observed, however, did not exceed the locomotor stimulant effects induced by cocaine administered in a novel environment. Thus, the cocaine sensitization manifested following a brief 20-min exposure to the test environment 1 day prior to cocaine administration represented a reversal of an inhibitory habituation effect. Cocaine-conditioned effects were also observed in both phases. These cocaine conditioned effects approximated, but did not exceed, the activation effects generated by a novel environment.

AB  - Cocaine induced psychosis (CIP) is a common, but not universal side effect of cocaine abuse. Factors underlying the development and severity of CIP remain poorly understood. This study tests the hypothesis that earlier age of initiation of regular use may increase the likelihood of developing CIP, or the severity of CIP symptoms. Methods: Cocaine use history and severity of CIP (if any) were assessed with the Cocaine Experience Questionnaire in 51 abstinent (3 weeks-1 year) cocaine dependent individuals. Subjects were divided into those with high and low CIP severity, and into those with early age of initiation of regular cocaine use, and later age of initiation. Various cutoffs between early and late age of initiation were used, ranging from 15 to 22 years. Results: From ages 17 through 20, controlling for cumulative duration of use, severity scores were significantly higher for the early initiation group than for the later initiation group (p values ranged from 0.031 to 0.036). Cumulative duration of use, but not age of initiation, significantly predicted initial development of CIP (p = 0.044). Conclusions: The data suggest that early age of initiation of regular cocaine use, occurring during vulnerable periods of brain development, may lead to increased severity of CIP.

AB  - Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a neuropeptide associated with the integration of the physiological and behavioral responses to stress. Recently, CRF₁ receptor antagonists have been shown to decrease cocaine self-administration and inhibit stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. The exact mechanisms underlying this effect are not clear. Based on the large amount of literature demonstrating an association between dopaminergic neurotransmission and reward-related behavior, the aim of the present study was to examine the effects of acute versus chronic CRF₁ receptor blockade on mesencephalic dopamine (DA) neuron activity (determined by in vivo extracellular recordings) and extracellular DA levels in the nucleus accumbens (Acb) (using in vivo microdialysis). In addition, the effect of CRF₁ receptor antagonism on cocaine-induced DA overflow in the Acb was examined and correlated with DA neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Acute (but not chronic) CRF₁ receptor blockade by CRA-0450 [1-[8-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-methylquinolin-4-yl]-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine-4-carboxamide benzenesulfonate] was found to significantly increase DA neuron population activity without affecting burst firing, average firing rate, or Acb DA levels. In addition, both acute and chronic CRF₁ receptor antagonism significantly reduced cocaine-stimulated DA overflow in the Acb, and this reduction was correlated with an attenuated cocaine-induced inhibition of DA population activity. Taken as a whole, these data demonstrate that, although DA neuron population activity exhibits tolerance to chronic CRF₁ receptor antagonism (by CRA-0450), tolerance does not develop to the selective inhibition of cocaine-induced DA release (in the Acb) and, as such, may be beneficial in the treatment of cocaine addiction.

AB  - Footshock stress can reinstate cocaine-seeking behavior through a central action of the stress-associated neurohormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Here we report (1) that footshock stress releases CRF in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the rat brain, (2) that, in cocaine-experienced but not in cocaine-naive rats, this CRF acquires control over local glutamate release, (3) that CRF-induced glutamate release activates the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, and (4) that, through this circuitry, footshock stress triggers relapse to drug seeking in cocaine-experienced animals. Thus, a long-lasting cocaine-induced neuroadaptation, presumably at the level of glutamate terminals in the VTA, appears to play an important role in stress-induced relapse to drug use. Similar neuroadaptations may be important for the comorbidity between addiction and other stress-related psychiatric disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aims: To determine the prevalence of HCV infection among intranasal cocaine users and evaluate underlying parental risk factors. Design, setting and participants: A cross-sectional study evaluated prospectively 60 patients admitted to a chemical dependency unit. Measurements: A standardized questionnaire was designed to obtain epidemiological data. Aminotransferases and anti-HCV antibodies were determined. Anti-HCV antibody positivity was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Findings: Fifteen (25%) patients of 60 tested intranasal cocaine users were anti-HCV positive. Ten (75%) of them had detectable HCV-RNA. Comparison between 15 anti-HCV positive and 45 anti-HCV negative patients showed significant differences in mean age (35 versus 27 years), estimated time of drug use (10 versus 4 years), rate of elevated ALT and/or AST (60% versus 16%) and presence of parenteral risk factors (100% versus 7%). Comparison between patients with and without elevated aminotransferases showed significant difference in mean duration of drug use (8 versus 5 years) and rate of anti-HCV positivity (56% versus 14%). Among 15 anti-HCV positive patients, HCV-RNA was detectable in all with elevated aminotransferases and only one of six with normal aminotransferases (100% versus 17%). Conclusions: While there was a high prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in this sample of intranasal cocaine users, the infection was highly correlated with the presence of intravenous (i.v.) drug use and duration of drug use. In this sample, therefore, intranasal cocaine use alone was not an important risk factor for HCV infection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Among cocaine addicts, there is a strong variation in response to relapse provoking factors like conditioned cues and renewed contact with the drug. Here we show that such large individual differences also exist in rats. Reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior was triggered by contingent presentation of a cocaine-conditioned cue or an amphetamine priming injection. We found no positive correlation between cue- and drug-controlled reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Rather, a slight, but significant negative correlation was observed, which was particularly evident in two subgroups of rats that responded highest following either amphetamine priming or cue presentation. A large middle group responded equally for both relapse provoking factors. Further, cocaine-seeking behavior during the first extinction session correlated positively with cue-induced reinstatement. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that the therapeutic efficacy of relapse prevention strategies may depend on individual sensitivity to distinct relapse provoking stimuli.

AB  - The pregnant rats received daily sc injections of cocaine (30 mg/kg) or saline from the gestational day (GD) 7 to GD 20. At 1 week postnatal, all pups were killed and the hippocampus, cortex and striatum were dissected out. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) under the basal condition and depolarization with high potassium (40 mM) were measured. The results showed that hippocampal BDNF levels under basal and depolarization conditions were all significantly lower in the pups prenatally exposed to cocaine than those exposed to saline. There were no significant differences in basal BDNF levels between the cocaine and saline groups in the cortex or striatum. However, the prenatally cocaine-treated pups showed significantly less BDNF release following high potassium depolarization than the saline-treated animals did in both these regions. The results support the suggestion that prenatal cocaine exposure decreases BDNF expression in the offspring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - During development, survival of midbrain dopamine neurons and specification of their phenotype are dependent upon the intracellular expression of a number of transcription factors, including Engrailed I, Pitx3, and Nurrl. The role of these transcription factors in the maintenance of the dopaminergic phenotype is less clear. In the present study, we show that each of these transcription factors is robustly expressed in adult dopamine neurons in human midbrain, and that cocaine abuse is associated with a significant decrease in the abundance of Nurrl and Pitx3 in these cells. These data suggest that cocaine abuse leads to a partial loss of dopaminergic phenotype. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cocaine addiction in humans is associated with long-term propensity to relapse. Using a rat relapse model, we found that cocaine seeking induced by exposure to cocaine-associated cues progressively increases after withdrawal. This progressive increase is associated with increases in brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF) levels within the mesolimbic dopamine system. Based on these findings, we studied whether BDNF infusions into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the cell body region of mesolimbic dopamine neurons, would potentiate cocaine seeking after withdrawal. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 10 d, and cocaine seeking was measured in extinction tests 3, 10, or 30 d after withdrawal. During testing, rats were exposed to contextual cues that had predicted cocaine availability during training, and lever presses resulted in contingent presentations of a discrete tone-light cue that was previously temporally paired with cocaine infusions. BDNF (0-0.75/μg/site) or nerve growth factor (NGF; O-0.75/μg/site) was infused into the VTA 1-2 hr after the last self-administration session. To examine the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in BDNF effects, U0126 (1 /μg/site), an MEK inhibitor, was used. A single intra-VTA infusion of BDNF, but not NGF, induced long-lasting enhancement of cocaine seeking for up to 30 d, an effect reversed by U0126. In contrast, neither BDNF infusions into the substantia nigra, nor acute intra-VTA BDNF infusions 2 hr before testing on day 3 of withdrawal, were effective. These data suggest that BDNF-mediated neuroadaptations in mesolimbic areas are involved in the persistent cocaine seeking induced by exposure to drug cues after withdrawal.

AB  - Investigates the frequency of adverse cocaine reactions and associated factors among regular cocaine misusers. A sample of 332 cocaine misusers from a range of treatment and nontreatment settings in Sao Paulo, Brazil, were interviewed using a questionnaire that includes the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), the CAGE, and an eight-item questionnaire investigating the frequency of specific adverse cocaine reactions. The most commonly described reactions were hot flushes (84%), uncontrollable shaking (76%), and feeling ill (75%). The most severe symptoms and least common were convulsions or fits (18%) and passing out (21%). Frequency of adverse reactions to cocaine was positively associated with out-of-treatment status, severity of cocaine dependence, ever having injected cocaine, using tranquilisers with cocaine, and GHQ score. Adverse reactions to cocaine are common among regular cocaine users. Some of the adverse effects, especially those on the heart and central nervous system, are potentially fatal. Preventive strategies should be developed to reduce the risk of adverse cocaine reactions. The findings are discussed in relation to the type of interventions that might be developed and lines of future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its structurally related proteins are involved in the developmental regulation of various brain neurons, including midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We recently reported EGF and EGF-receptor abnormalities in both the brain tissues and blood of schizophrenic patients. Administration of EGF to neonatal rats transiently increases tyrosine hydroxylase expression and subsequently results in behavioral abnormalities in prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle, locomotor activity, and social interaction after development. The enhanced locomotor and stereotypic responses of the neonatally EGF-treated rats are considered to be an animal model for positive schizophrenia symptoms. In the present study, we investigated psychostimulant sensitivity of neonatally EGF-treated rats. At the adult stage, EGF-treated rats were challenged with cocaine (15 mg/kg) or methamphetamine (1 mg/kg), and conditioned place preference and locomotor activity were examined. The rats that received EGF during the neonatal period had significantly higher conditioned place preference for where cocaine or methamphetamine was administered than controls. The neonatal EGF treatment enhanced behavioral response to methamphetamine and behavioral sensitization to cocaine at the adult stage. Drug-naive controls gradually increased locomotor responses to cocaine during their daily injections, whereas EGF-treated rats exhibited a larger increase in cocaine responses. These results indicate that overactivation of the EGF receptors (ErbB1) during the neonatal period influences future sensitivity to psychostimulants. Our findings indicate a potential link between EGF-receptor activation and drug addiction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

MDMA is a psychoactive substance that cause liver damage, but its hepatotoxicity is dose-related in some patients. We present a 17-year-old girl admitted to our department because of abdominal pain, jaundice, fever and vomiting. Three months ago she started using five to eight pills of MDMA daily. She also consumed alcohol (beer, vodka)—more than 40 g day. During her stay in hospital we performed an abdominal ultrasound (USG): liver not enlarged, hyperechogenic, gallbladder inflammation with wall's diameter over 8 mm, no gallstones. Bile ducts, pancreas, spleen, kidneys had normal diameter. The clinical symptoms resolved in 5 days with treatment. All biochemical results were within the normal ranges in 8 weeks.

AB  - Using a rat model of drug craving, we found that the responsiveness to cocaine cues progressively increases or incubates over the first 60 d of cocaine withdrawal. Here we studied whether alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels within the mesolimbic dopamine system are associated with this incubation phenomenon. BDNF is involved in synaptic plasticity and was found to enhance responding for cues associated with natural rewards. Rats were trained to press a lever to receive intravenous cocaine or oral sucrose for 6 hr/d for 10 d; each earned reward was paired with a tone-light cue. Resumption of lever-pressing behavior was then assessed on days 1, 30, or 90 of reward withdrawal. First, resistance to extinction was assessed during 6 hr in which lever presses were not reinforced and the cue was absent. Second, cue-induced reinstatement was assessed after extinction during 1 hr in which responding led to cue presentations. Other rats were killed without testing, and BDNF and nerve growth factor (NGF) protein levels were measured in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), accumbens, and amygdala. Lever pressing during extinction and cue-induced reinstatement tests of cocaine craving progressively increased after cocaine withdrawal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Animal models provide insight into the underlying neurobiology of the reinforcing (SR) and discriminative stimulus (SD) effects of cocaine and tools for evaluating potential therapeutics. Chapter I describes how a multitude of variables—pharmacological, historical, and behavioral—contribute to the effects of cocaine. Methods used to study drug effects are discussed in terms of the unconditioned effects of cocaine, use of operant methodology to study the conditioned effects of cocaine, and role of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in propagating effects. Because rate-altering effects of cocaine influence behavior under operant schedules, generation of uncontaminated measures of SR strength requires determining the precise influence of these effects on cocaine-maintained behavior. In Chapter II, the effect of one variable, post-reinforcement time-out (TO) duration, on the SR strength of cocaine was assessed under a progressive-ratio schedule in rhesus monkeys. It was demonstrated that measures of SR strength were influenced by TO length, possibly due to pharmacokinetic factors, and schedules with long TOs may provide uncontaminated assessments of SR strength. The main focus of this dissertation was whether cocaine-like S D effects were necessary for cocaine to have SR effects. There are dissociations between human studies utilizing within-subjects designs and animal studies utilizing between-groups designs regarding concordance of SD and SR effects. In Chapter III, a novel model assessing the SD and SR effects of cocaine using a within-subjects design in rhesus monkeys is described; this model demonstrated a dissociation of the two effects common to what has been observed in human studies. Finally, the dopaminergic component of the SD and S R effects of cocaine was assessed in Chapter IV using two novel DA D3 specific compounds. Antagonism of D3 receptors attenuated the SD and SR effects of cocaine in rhesus monkeys supporting that D3 receptors are viable targets for cocaine pharmacotherapy development. Overall, these results highlight some pharmacological and behavioral determinants of the SD and SR effects of cocaine. While tremendous progress has been made in understanding cocaine abuse, the field would benefit from parametric analyses of established models, paradigm standardization, and continued development of novel models better approximating the human condition.

AB  - Stress-related neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) may play an important role in mediating behavioural changes induced by prior experience with cocaine. Repeated exposure to cocaine may induce a form of sensitization in CRF systems that makes animals more responsive to CRF following prolonged drug-free periods. To study the effects of repeated cocaine exposure on locomotor activity induced by different doses of CRF after drug-free periods ranging from 24 h to 28 days, male rats were injected once daily for 7 days with cocaine or saline. In experiment 1, starting 10 days after the last injection, animals were tested for their locomotor response to intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of vehicle and three doses of CRF. In experiment 2, animals were tested for their locomotor response to ICV injections of CRF after drug-free periods of 1-2, 10-11 and 28-29 days. Compared to saline pre-exposed animals, cocaine pre-exposed animals showed a significantly greater locomotor response to CRF at all doses tested (experiment 1) and after drug-free periods of up to 28 days (experiment 2). Our results, with clear and extremely consistent magnitude of effect, suggest that cocaine preexposure induces long-term changes in the responsivity of the central nervous system to CRF.

AB  - We investigated, in mice, the influence of life experience on the vulnerability to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a major neurotoxin that induces a Parkinson's disease-like syndrome in humans, and to cocaine, a potent psychostimulant that promotes drug addiction. Our findings show that adult C57BL/6 mice raised in an enriched environment (EE) for only 2 months are significantly more resistant to both drugs compared with mice raised in a standard environment (SE). Indeed, EE mice showed decreased locomotor activity in response to cocaine (10 and 20 mg/kg) as well as a different pattern of c-los expression in the striatum compared with SE mice. After MPTP treatment, SE mice showed a 75% loss of dopamine neurons, whereas EE mice showed only a 40% loss. The dopamine transporter plays a key role in mediating the effects of both drugs. We thus investigated the regulation of its expression. EE mice showed less dopamine transporter binding in the striatum and less dopamine transporter mRNA per dopamine neuron at the cellular level as demonstrated by in situ hybridization. In addition, enriched environment promoted an increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the striatum. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the time course effects of extinction of cocaine self-administration behavior on corticotropin releasing hormone (CRF) gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Seventy-two littermate male Lewis rats were randomly assigned in triads to one of three conditions: (1) contingent intravenous self-administration of 1 mg/kg/injection of cocaine, (2) non-contingent injections of either 1 mg/kg/injection of cocaine or (3) saline yoked to the intake of the self-administering subject. The self-administering rats were trained to self-administer cocaine under a fixed ratio 5 schedule of reinforcement for a minimum of 3 weeks. After stable baseline levels of drug intake had been reached, saline was substituted for drug. Following this first extinction period, cocaine self-administration was reinstated for an additional period of 2 weeks. Immediately after cessation of the last session of cocaine self-administration and 1, 5 and 10 days after the second extinction period, animal brains in each triad were removed to be processed for IHHS. The results suggest that, changes in hypothalamic CRF gene expression are differentially affected depending upon the type of cocaine administration.

AB  - Neurotrophic factors, such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), may play a role in drug-induced biochemical and behavioural adaptations that characterize addiction. We found that GDNF mRNA levels are lower in the striatum of rats that chronically self-administered cocaine. Therefore, we examined the effect of transplanted cells used as a biodelivery system for GDNF on cocaine self-administration in rats. A human astrocyte-like cell line, which produces and excretes GDNF, was transplanted into the striatum and nucleus accumbens of rats. These rats showed a significantly lower number of active lever presses in the cocaine self-administration paradigm compared with control rats. Moreover, rats that received a chronic infusion of GDNF via a micro-osmotic pump also exhibited weak cocaine self-administration. Therefore, we conclude that exogenous augmentation of GDNF repositories may be useful in suppressing cocaine self-administration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) affects the development of brain neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine and serotonin systems that are important for cocaine's rewarding and locomotor stimulatory properties. Human genomic markers within or near the BDNF locus have been linked to or associated with substance abuse. Post-mortem human brain specimens reveal individual differences in the levels of BDNF mRNA and in mRNA splicing patterns. To assess the effects of lifelong alterations in the levels of BDNF expression on a measure of psychostimulant reward, we have compared locomotor stimulant and rewarding effects of cocaine in heterozygous BDNF knockout mice with effects in their wild-type littermates. Heterozygous BDNF knockout mice displayed less locomotion during habituation and less locomotion after cocaine injections. Cocaine-conditioned place preferences were reduced in the BDNF heterozygotes. These mice displayed no significant difference from saline control values at a dose of 10mg/kg s.c. cocaine, although they exhibited cocaine-induced preference at a 20mg/kg dose. These data confirm important roles for BDNF in psychostimulant actions, presumably via neurotrophic effects on dopamine and serotonin systems. Furthermore, these data support suggestions that...

AB  - Compares buprenorphine-maintained patients with lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD, N = 53) with those never depressed (ND, N = 96) on cocaine and opiate-free urines during a 12-wk outpatient double-blind,placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. The 149 Ss were assigned to 4 groups: 1) desipramine (DMI) + contingency management (CM); 2) DMI + noncontingency management (NCM); 3) placebo + CM; and 4) placebo + NCM. Urine toxicologies were performed thrice weekly and the CES-D was performed monthly. The MDD group had a larger proportion of females and were more likely to be married than the ND group. Treatment retention did not vary by depression status. Hierarchical Linear Modeling found that depressive symptoms decreased comparably across the four treatment groups. Although participation in CM improved drug-free urines more for patients with MDD than for the ND group, treatment with DMI was significantly more efficacious for the ND group than for the MDD group. These results suggest that patients with MDD may respond better to behavioral treatments such as CM than to desipramine plus buprenorphine. The ND cocaine-abusing, opiate-dependent patients may be more responsive to the anticraving effects of DMI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The explosive and ongoing injecting drug use-related HIV-1 epidemic in Vancouver continues to receive international attention. This study was conducted to determine how patterns of cocaine use influence the risk of HIV infection. The Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study is an open prospective cohort of injecting drug users that began in May 1996. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine behavioral and drug use patterns reported in the 6 months prior to HIV seroconversion. One-hundred and nine incident HIV infections have been observed during a mean follow-up of 31 months, from 940 HIV-seronegative participants. During the 6 months prior to seroconversion, predictors of HIV infection were injecting cocaine use [adjusted hazards ratio (AHR), 3.72], incarceration, unstable housing (AHR, 2.36), methadone maintenance treatment, and Aboriginal ethnicity. Injecting cocaine use was predictive of HIV infection in a dose-dependent fashion. Compared with infrequent cocaine users, participants who averaged more than three injections per day were seven times more likely to contract HIV. In addition, the time to HIV infection was accelerated among regular cocaine injectors independent of concurrent heroin use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Data on use and misuse of six classes of illicit substances by male twin pairs were used to examine whether genetic and shared environmental risk factors for substance use disorders are substance-specific or -nonspecific in their effect. Lifetime history of use and abuse/dependence of cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, sedatives, stimulants, and opiates was assessed at personal interview in both members of 1,196 male-male twin pairs (aged 20-58 yrs). Multivariate twin modeling of substance-nonspecific (common) and substance-specific genetic, shared environmental, and unique environmental risk factors was performed. High levels of comorbidity involving the different substance categories were observed for both use and abuse/dependence. One common genetic factor was found to have a strong influence on risk for illicit use and abuse/dependence for all six substance classes. A modest influence of substance-specific genetic factors was seen for use but not for abuse/dependence. Shared environmental factors were more important for use than for abuse/dependence and were mediated entirely through a single common factor.

AB  - Notes that given the popularity of the mouse for genetic analysis of drug-induced behaviors, a place conditioning model of drug-seeking behavior was used to examined the ability of cocaine (COC) to reinstate extinguished conditioned reward in mice. In a series of experiments, COC place conditioning was produced in male C5713L/6 (116) mice by 4 pairings of COC (15 or 25 mg/kg, ip) with the non-preferred compartment of a 2-compartment place conditioning apparatus. Following a post-conditioning test (Post-Test), place conditioning was extinguished by repeated testing. The mice were then challenged with 1 of 5 COC doses (0, 5, 10, 15 or 25 mg/kg, ip) and allowed free access to both environments. Following extinction, COC injections reinstated place conditioning to 100% or greater, relative to the Post-Test. In a control experiment, mice received either COC or saline (SAL) paired with non-preferred compartment and were then challenged with either COC (15 mg/kg, ip) or SAL on the Post-Test. COC-conditioned, but not SAL-conditioned, mice exhibited place conditioning when tested in a COC-free state. COC injection on the Post-Test elicited an increase in approach behavior in both SAL- and COC-conditioned mice and this increase was equivalent to that produced by COC conditioning alone.

AB  - This cross-sectional study investigated factors associated with first entry to treatment and with treatment re-entry among 313 cocaine users recruited from community and treatment settings in Brazil. Measurements included structured questionnaire including selected items from the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), General Health Questionnaire, Version 28 (GHQ-28), CAGE and the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS). Higher dose use, being a problematic drinker and increased awareness of their problem were associated with increased odds of making first contact with an agency. Greater severity of dependence, being involved in acquisitive crime and social support increased the chance of treatment re-entry. Being involved in acquisitive crimes and concerns about confidentiality were associated with decreased odds of first treatment contact. Being a problematic drinker was associated with decreased odds of re-entry treatment. These findings suggest that the distinction between first treatment contact and subsequent entry to treatment is useful, clinically relevant and deserving of further investigation.

AB  - Assessed the association between child/adolescent sexual abuse--including specific type of abuse and perpetrator of abuse--and lifetime crack use in a sample of 1,478 female sexual partners (mean age 32 yrs) of male injection drug users. About 64% of sample women had ever used crack; 56% had been sexually abused by age 18. In logistic regression analyses, any sexual abuse in childhood, penetrative sexual abuse in childhood, and sexual abuse by a family member in childhood were significantly associated with lifetime crack use. Sexual abuse in adolescence was indirectly associated with lifetime crack use through running away from home and rape in adulthood. Given that many of these Ss reported drug treatment experience, such programs may provide the best setting for helping women with both substance use and sexual abuse issues.

AB  - Determined if variations in opioid pretreatment time would affect how μ opioid agonists interact with cocaine. Rats were trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg cocaine from saline. One group of Ss received morphine prior to cumulative doses of cocaine. These pretreatment times were selected to overlap with states of acute opioid tolerance or acute opioid dependence as demonstrated by previous studies. A 2nd group was administered naloxone 5 min prior to cumulative cocaine doses, with or without a 4-h morphine or methadone pretreatment. In a 3rd procedure, the same Ss used in the 2nd experiment were also tested for time-dependent changes in the analgesic effect of morphine using a hot-plate assay. Morphine pretreatment 1 h prior to assessment of the cocaine dose-response function significantly enhanced the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine. However, neither 0.5-h or 4-h morphine pretreatment had any effect. When naloxone was administered 4 h following either morphine or methadone and 5 min prior to assessment of the cocaine dose-response curve, the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine were significantly attenuated. In assessing morphine-induced analgesia, paw-lick latency was significantly longer at 1 h and shorter at 4 h following morphine administration.

AB  - This article is a descriptive analysis of the structural factors facilitating a career in drug dealing. A field study focusing on the commitment paths of 6 middle-level, suburban-based cocaine dealers (aged 29–56 yrs) was conducted over a 1.5-yr period. Findings indicated that Ss' entry into full-time trafficking was instituted by opportunities developed in the context of conventional occupational careers, and through the social networks and drug use patterns that were prevalent in otherwise conventional occupational subcultures. Ss sold primarily to friends and acquaintances who were already drug customers; however, the work-based interaction networks established in the context of prior conventional careers provided the suburban dealers with an opportunity to sell drugs to a host of willing buyers in middle-class settings that were relatively safe and predictable. In addition, denial of responsibility, injury, victim, and condemnation of condemners all served as viable neutralization techniques. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This descriptive study presents a method of identifying factors associated with a non-problematic level of functioning with 10 non-treatment cocaine users (aged 21–46 yrs). A subjective assessment of an acceptable level of functioning was verified by the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) screening instrument (A. T. McLellan et al., 1992). Findings indicated that non-problematic, non-treatment cocaine users are from diverse social classes, have social and economic concerns comparable to the general population, and share similar values with the general population. In contrast to the substance use or abuse treatment approach of total abstinence, a continuum model is presented ranging from non-problematic to highly problematic use. Implications for rehabilitation counselors include awareness of the continuum model, familiarity with the ASI use as a brief screening measure in counseling, and enhancing non-problematic substance users' self-efficacy in safely controlling their substance use.

AB  - Studied the relationship between the pattern of cocaine use and cerebral perfusion in cocaine addicts. 30 male cocaine addicts aged 20–40 yrs in Brazil were assessed with 99 m-Tc-hexametilpropilenoamina-oxime single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Cerebral perfusion was analyzed in relation to the pattern and the amount of cocaine use. The results indicate that 80% of the sample had some degree of impairment in brain perfusion, either focal or diffuse. The findings did not show any difference in the perfusion patterns of sniffers and crack smokers, and no relationship was found between the severity of SPECT abnormalities and the amount of drug consumption. However, the length of cocaine use correlated with the severity of cerebral perfusion. The CT findings of abstinent users and active users differed.

AB  - Examined the relationship between interpersonal, intrapersonal and situational factors at 6, 12 and 18 mo after entrance to continuing care, and cocaine use in subsequent periods. A randomized clinical trial with a 2-yr followup was conducted at an outpatient US Veterans administration substance abuse treatment program. 32 cocaine-dependent male veterans (mean age 41 yrs) entering continuing care participated in a 12-Step focused group treatment or individualized prevention continuing care. Motivation, coping and mood, social support, co-morbid problem severity, treatment attendance, self-help participation and cocaine use variables were assessed at each followup. Results show that during the 2-yr followup, patients used cocaine on fewer than 8% days in each of the 4 6-mo periods, which represented a highly significant decrease in relation cocaine use prior to treatment. In univariate analyses, abstinence commitment, self-efficacy, positive mood, support from family, employment, attendance in continuing care and self-help participation at 2 or more of the followups predicted less cocaine use in subsequent 6-mo periods. In multivariate analyses, degree of self-help participation emerged as the strongest and consistent predictor of cocaine use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Tested whether differences in locomotor responses to novelty and psychostimulants and sensitization following repeated drug exposure, are core features of drug addiction. Rats with prior cocaine-self-administration experience were used. Animals with low and high locomotor responses to novelty and the amphetamine pre-test showed similar levels of cocaine-seeking behavior during extinction and reinstatement testing. Locomotor responses to amphetamine following cocaine self-administration (post-test) also failed to determine cocaine-seeking behavior. Conversely, high levels of amphetamine-induced reinstatement were associated specifically with escalating cocaine intake. The animals also developed locomotor sensitization to amphetamine following cocaine self-administration (post-test vs pre-test), but the capacity to develop locomotor sensitization was not sufficient to determine a propensity for cocaine-seeking behavior. The findings suggest that the relationship between locomotor responses to novelty, amphetamine and behavioral sensitization and cocaine-seeking behavior during abstinence is complex, while the level of drug intake during prior self-administration is a primary determinant of this behavior.

AB  - Examined to what extent the anorectic effects of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) might be mediated via the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) in male rats. α-Melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), the MC4-R agonist, administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) at a dose of 1 nmol, reduced food intake by approximately half. Agouti-related protein, a biologically active fragment of the endogenous MC4-R antagonist, administered ICV at a dose of 1 nmol completely blocked the anorectic effect of 1 nmol α-MSH. CART (0.2 nmol), GLP-1 (3 nmol) and CRF (0.3 nmol) produced a reduction in feeding of approximately the same magnitude as 1 nmol α-MSH. Agouti-related protein (1 nmol) administered ICV did not block the anorectic effects of CART. Agouti-related protein also did not block the anorectic effects of GLP-1 or CRF. These results demonstrate that CART, in addition to GLP-I and CRF primarily acts via agouti-related protein independent pathways. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We have shown that intracerebroventricular administration of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor antagonist D-Phe CRF12–41, blocks footshock-induced reinstatement of drug seeking in cocaine-trained rats. We now report that D-Phe acts in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and not in the amygdala, to block footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. In addition, CRF injections in the BNST, and not in the amygdala, are sufficient to reinstate cocaine seeking. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously on a fixed ratio (FR-1) schedule of reinforcement. After 5 drug-free days, animals were returned to the self-administration chambers and given daily extinction and reinstatement test sessions. To test the effects of D-Phe CRF12–41 on stress-induced reinstatement, rats were pretreated with vehicle or D-Phe in either the BNST (10 or 50 ng per side) or amygdala (50 or 500 ng per side) before being exposed to 15 min of intermittent footshock stress. To test whether injections of CRF itself could induce reinstatement, rats were given vehicle or CRF in either the BNST (100 or 300 ng per side) or amygdala (300 ng per side) 15 min before the session. Injections of D-Phe into the BNST completely blocked footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking; injections of CRF itself in this structure induced reinstatement. Injections of these compounds into the amygdala were without effect. These findings suggest that activation of CRF receptors in the BNST, but not in the amygdala, is critical for footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking.

AB  - Reports that at the initiation of cocaine self-administration sessions (CC), neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NA) exhibit a spontaneous transition in firing rate from activity unrelated to the reinforced response, to 1 of 4 types of patterned discharges. This transition in NA cell firing is CC dose-dependent and is accompanied by a shift from high response rates at the start of the session ('Load-up' behavior) to a lower steady rate of responding thereafter (termed 'Session' phase responding). Exp 1 examined the effects of pre-session, response-independent delivery of CC on behavioral/neural transitions. Results revealed an absence of Load-up responding and the immediate onset of NA patterned activity at the start of the session. Exp 2 examined the involvement of dopamine D vs D₂ receptors in mediating the corresponding behavioral/neural transitions. SCH23390 significantly increased the number of Load-up responses and the number of responses following the Load-up phase. Eticlopride increased the number of Session responses, but did not alter the number of Load-up responses at any dose tested. The transition in NA cell firing corresponded with the shift in behavioral responding and was delayed within the session following SCH23390 but not eticlopride pretreatment.

AB  - Acute exposure to cocaine transiently induces several Fos family transcription factors in the nucleus accumbens, a region of the brain that is important for addiction. In contrast, chronic exposure to cocaine does not induce these proteins, but instead causes the persistent expression of highly stable isoforms of ΔFosB. ΔFosB is also induced in the nucleus accumbens by repeated exposure to other drugs of abuse, including amphetamine, morphine, nicotine and phencyclidine. The sustained accumulation of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens indicates that this transcription factor may mediate some of the persistent neural and behavioral plasticity that accompanies chronic drug exposure. Using transgenic mice in which ΔFosB can be induced in adults in the subset of nucleus accumbens neurons in which cocaine induces the protein, the authors show that ΔFosB expression increases the responsiveness of an animal to the rewarding and locomotor-activating effects of cocaine. These effects of ΔFosB appear to be mediated partly by induction of the AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole) glutamate receptor subunit GluR2 in the nucleus accumbens. These results support a model in which ΔFosB enhances sensitivity to cocaine to possibly contribute to cocaine addiction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the degree of correspondence between relapse vulnerability factors assessed at intake to aftercare in 100 cocaine dependent patients (mean age 40 yrs) and proximal factors in their first cocaine relapse and near miss episodes during a 1-yr follow-up. Proximal factors in relapse and near miss episodes were also compared. Correspondence between experiences associated with prior use and experiences in the week prior to relapse and near miss episodes was generally poor. Psychiatric and family/social problem severity and coping factors at intake to aftercare predicted experiences in the week prior to near misses, and to a lesser degree, experiences in the week prior to relapse episodes. However, relapse vulnerability factors were also associated with psychiatric and family/social problem severity and mood during abstinent periods. Therefore, there was little evidence of specificity in relationships between relapse vulnerability factors and experiences prior to relapse. Proximal measures of coping, sensation seeking, positive experiences, and unpleasant affect differentiated relapses from near misses in a within-subjects analysis.

AB  - Investigated the role of endogenous corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in mediating the 'anxiety-like' effect 48 hrs after the cessation of saline or chronic cocaine treatment in male rats, using the defensive burying paradigm and elevated plus-maze. Rats received daily injections of cocaine or vehicle. 48 hrs after the last injection, Ss were tested in the plus-maze and then in the defensive burying paradigm. In a 2nd experiment, intracerebroventricular/ly (icv) cannulae were implanted at the lateral ventricle. Ss were allowed a 1-wk period for recovery before starting the chronic drug treatment. The defensive burying testing took place 48 h after cessation of the treatment. The CRF antagonist D-phe CRF(12–41) was injected 5 min before the 15-min testing. An anxiogenic-like effect following chronic cocaine treatment was demonstrated with the defensive burying paradigm, but not with the elevated plus-maze. This anxiety-like response was attenuated by icv pretreatment with the CRF antagonist D-Phe CRF(12–4l), with the highest dose of the CRF antagonist reversing the observed anxiogenic-like response. Data suggest that brain CRF may be substantially involved in the development of anxiety-like responses related to cocaine withdrawal and could be important for future drug dependence treatments.

AB  - The factor structure of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) substance disorder criteria is examined among 244 alcohol, 519 cannabis, 215 cocaine and 294 opiate users to determine the dimensionality of abuse and dependence criteria within each of these drug classes and whether a common construct can be generalized across drug classes. 12-mo criterion prevalence was assessed as part of the World Health Organization's Study on the Reliability and Validity of the Alcohol and Drug Use Disorder Instruments in various settings at eight sites around the world using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN). A majority of respondents were recruited from non-treatment settings. In addition to exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis was used to analyse factor structures using weighted least square methods and tetrachoric correlation matrices. Multi-sample analysis techniques were used to model differences between drug-classes. Data analyses identified a single factor solution for each user population and across user populations. However, analyses of data from users reporting low to moderate symptomatology identified a 2-dimensional construct among alcohol, cannabis and opiate users consisting of a major 'dependence' factor and a lesser 'abuse' factor.

AB  - Investigated the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which enhances the survival and function of dopaminergic neurons, on stimulant-induced locomotor sensitization and responding for conditioned reward (CR). In Exp 1, BDNF was infused into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or ventral tegmental area over 2 wks, and the psychomotor stimulant effects of cocaine (5–11 mg/kg) were studied. It was found that BDNF enhanced the initial stimulant effects of cocaine and seemed to facilitate the development of sensitization to repeated cocaine doses. Exp 2 examined the effects of intra-NAc BDNF infusions on responding for CR. BDNF-treated rats showed twice as many CR responses compared with controls when saline was first administered. BDNF enhanced responding on the CR lever more than four times that seen in control animals after a cocaine injection (10 mg/kg). The enhanced response of cocaine in BDNF-treated Ss persisted for more than a month after the BDNF infusions had stopped, indicating long lasting changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system caused by BID administration. Exp 3 examined locomotor sensitization to cocaine in heterozygous BDNF knock-out mice and found that the development of sensitization was delayed compared with wild-type littermates.

AB  - Comments on an article by C. D’Sa et al. (see record [rid]2011-22661-010[/rid]). D'Sa et al. report that elevated plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are associated with relapse in recently abstinent cocaine addicts. Although the results of D’Sa et al. are intriguing, obtaining BDNF measures from a large cohort of recently recovering cocaine addicts is probably premature. Some limitations of the study restrict its interpretation. Only three sequential daily measures of BDNF during abstinence were obtained. No data on baseline BDNF or BDNF following relapse are available. Additionally, there are no data on the effect of controlled dosing with cocaine on BDNF levels, so it is not yet possible to know whether elevated serum BDNF is a good or bad prognostic sign. For BDNF to become an accepted biomarker, we need to know BDNF levels in currently abusing addicts, the effects of acute exposure to cocaine on BDNF levels, and whether there are differences between addicts and abusers in BDNF response before we can assign a prognostic value to a range of BDNF serum levels. Recent human data suggest that the brain contributes substantially to peripheral BDNF levels at rest and during exercise. Thus, it is possible, but not proven, that the elevated serum BDNF levels seen by D’Sa et al. in cocaine addicts prone to relapse partially reflect elevated brain BDNF levels.

AB  - Examined the role of brain corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the adrenal hormone corticosterone in stress- and cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking in male Long Evans rats. The ability of footshock stress and priming injections of cocaine to induce relapse to cocaine seeking was studied after intracerebroventricular infusions of the CRF receptor antagonist D-Phe CRF12–41 after adrenalectomy, and after adrenalectomy with corticosterone replacement. Rats were allowed to self administer cocaine for 3 hrs daily for 10–14 days and were then placed on an extinction schedule during which saline was substituted for cocaine. Tests for reinstatement were given after intermittent footshock and after priming injections of saline and cocaine. Footshock reinstated cocaine seeking in both intact animals and with corticosterone replacement but not in adrenalectomized animals. The CRF receptor antagonist D-Phe CRF12–41 blocked footshock-induced reinstatement at all doses tested in both intact animals and animals with corticosterone replacement. Reinstatement by priming injections of cocaine was only minimally attenuated by adrenalectomy and by pretreatment with D-Phe CRF12–41. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Determined the doses of cocaine that induce anxiogenic-like behavior (ALB) in the elevated plus maze (EPM) in male rats, examined whether cocaine-associated contextual cues are capable of eliciting ALB in the absence of the drug, and identified possible mechanisms through which cocaine-associated cues affect behavior in the EPM. In Exp 1, Ss were injected with 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, or 30 mg/kg cocaine HCl or saline for 6 days. On day 6, Ss were tested in the EPM 25 min after injection with cocaine or saline. Ss chronically treated with the 3 doses of cocaine exhibited a dose-dependent increase in ALB in the EPM, compared with the saline-treated group. In Exp 2, cocaine-induced (30 mg/kg) conditioning was achieved using a simple contextual design. On the final day of the experiment, Ss were exposed for 25 min to the cocaine-associated contextual cues, then placed in the EPM. Results suggest that contextual cues associated with repeated treatment with 30 mg/kg cocaine are capable of eliciting ALB in the absence of the drug and that the corticotropin-releasing factor mediates the expression of ALBs in the EPM following exposure to cocaine associated cues.

AB  - Examines cocaine and the concept of addiction with attention given to environmental factors in drug compulsions. The history of the concept of addiction and the raise of cocaine over heroin as the popular drug of choice is discussed. Also, research on cocaine's addictiveness in both human and animal populations as well as differences between the 2 populations are presented. Current models of addiction, for both cocaine and heroin, are viewed as reducing drug use patterns to the properties of drugs and biological characteristics of the user. However, the author states that naturalistic human drug use and drug taking by animals in the laboratory instead reinforce the idea that use of all drugs depends on the user's environment. The author maintains that even the most severe examples of compulsive drug use can be reversed when key elements in the setting are modified. It is concluded that these findings should play a fundamental role in both scientific and public conceptions of addiction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studied the dependence of aversive properties of cocaine on activation of endogenous corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) systems in 202 male rats using taste conditioning and runway self-administration paradigms. Systemic cocaine administration produced a conditioned saccharin aversion which was dose-dependently potentiated by central administration of the CRF receptor antagonist {d}-phe CRF (12–41). In addition, iv cocaine administration produced runway goal-box avoidance and conditioned place avoidance responses which were significantly accelerated by CRF antagonist treatment. In contrast, CRF receptor stimulation using CRF itself abolished cocaine-induced increases in goal latency in the runway paradigm. This generalized involvement of CRF systems in cocaine-related motivational/associative states is consistent with the comprehensive role of CRF in mediating emotional responses to non-drug stressors.

AB  - Studied whether contextual cues associated with cocaine effects could elicit increases in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity concomitant with conditioned increases in locomotor output, and whether endogenous corticotropin-releasing factor mediates these effects. Exp 1 confirmed that chronic cocaine treatment does not alter corticosteroid responses (of male rats) to cocaine. In Exp 2, conditioned endocrine effects of cocaine were examined in 3 groups of rats (paired, unpaired, control) after 7 consecutive days of treatment. Results show that blood corticosterone concentrations and locomotor activity in the paired group were significantly higher than in the unpaired and control groups. However, pretreatment of the rats in Exp 3 with the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) antagonist, α-helical CRF9–41 prior to exposure to cocaine-associated contextual cues attenuated the conditioned increase in blood corticosterone concentrations. It is suggested that these increases may further predispose an organism to the reinforcing effects of the drug or enhance susceptibility to drug-taking behavior.

AB  - Conducted a prospective study to test the hypothesis that cocaine use is a risk factor for neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia (NIAD). The study sample consisted of a high-risk group for NIAD, males aged 17-45 yrs who had received high-potency neuroleptics within 24 hrs of admission and had not used neuroleptics in the month prior to admission. 29 patients, 9 cocaine users and 20 nonusers, entered the study, which lasted 2 yrs. Patients were followed for 7 days. Cocaine-using psychiatric patients developed significantly more NIAD than did nonusers. Findings suggest that cocaine use is a major risk factor for NIAD and should be added to the list of well-known risk factors. The authors suggest that cocaine-using psychiatric patients who are started on a regimen of neuroleptics should also be administered an anticholinergic for at least 7 days to prevent NIAD.

AB  - Examined factors contributing to an increased risk of PPD positive status among 147 inpatients dually diagnosed for mental illness and substance abuse in a large urban hospital. Ninety-three percent (N = 137) were tested for PPD on admission. The rate of positive PPDs was 30.7%. Significant correlates of PPD positive status were the diagnosis of schizophrenia/psychosis NOS, and crack cocaine use in the 30 days prior to admission. A multiple logistic regression revealed a relative risk of 3.53 for PPD positive status for the crack using group and a relative risk of 2.16 for PPD positive status for the schizophrenic group. Reasons for why patients whose primary drug of abuse is crack cocaine and those whose diagnosis is schizophrenia/psychosis NOS may be at an increased risk for exposure to tuberculosis are discussed as are the implications for public health.

AB  - Cocaine is an addictive psychomotor stimulant that produces a number of subjective and behavioral effects, such as intense euphoria, acute psychosis, and epileptiform seizures as well as dysphoria, anxiety, and depression in humans. Stress may increase the propensity to develop cocaine addiction in humans. During the last several years the author's research has focused on the role of brain corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in mediating some of the effects of cocaine in rats, rhesus monkeys, and humans.

AB  - Cocaine addiction in humans develops gradually with repeated administrations and persists long after cocaine has cleared the body. The mechanisms underlying this persistent form of neuroplasticity are not understood and can involve both structural and biochemical mechanisms. The long time course for cocaine addiction in humans and for development of cocaine self-administration in animal models suggests the involvement of alterations in gene expression leading to altered signaling in the brain. We are presently purifying the chronic Fos-related antigens (Fras) to obtain amino acid sequence in order to directly examine our hypothesis about the effects of repeated cocaine administration on AP-1-dependent transcription and gene expression in the brain. Specific issues addressed in this chapter include: regulation of gene expression; The AP-1 transcription factor; psychostimulants regulate the AP-1 transcription factor; the AP-1 complex contains novel proteins called chronic Fras; what are the identities of the chronic Fras; and the chronic Fras heterodimerize with JunD.

AB  - Vulnerability to drug abuse is a complex trait determined by both genetic and environmental influences. The purpose of this chapter is to examine strategies for studying genetic influences in drug abuse, drawing from both animal and human research. However, because genotype and environmental influences are inextricably linked, environmental factors that contribute to drug abuse are also briefly reviewed. Special attention is paid to the need for additional research on gene and environment interactions in drug abuse, as the effect of the genotype depends on the environment (past history and current circumstances), and the effect of the environment depends on the genotype.

AB  - In order to explore the possible confounding effects of age, race, sex, and SES on developmental outcomes of prenatal cocaine exposure, 2 matched samples of 3–6 yr olds (20 Ss with cocaine/polydrug in utero exposure and 20 Ss with no prenatal drug exposure) were compared on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (4th edition), the Social Skills Rating System, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale—Survey Form, the Preschool Language Scale (3rd edition), and the Child Behavior Checklist . None of the 40 Ss had attended or were currently enrolled in preschool programs. Both groups had scores approximately 1 standard deviation below the expected means in social skills, auditory comprehension, and expressive language. Likewise, externalizing behavior difficulties were approximately 1 standard deviation above the means for both groups. Results suggest in utero drug exposure had no independent impact on cognitive, social, language, and behavioral developmental outcomes. when the confounding variables of age, ethnicity, gender, and SES were controlled.

AB  - Pharmacotherapy trials for cocaine abuse among methadone-maintained patients have typically reported negative findings as well as high rates of cocaine use during the trial. The contribution of motivational factors to these results is a potentially important, underinvestigated area. This article points out that some methadone-maintained patients may enter a trial for cocaine abuse with little desire for treatment, motivated primarily to continue receiving methadone or to avoid program sanctions for continued cocaine use. Participation in clinical trials may constitute a phase delaying discharge in a cyclic pattern of multiple treatment episodes. Testing a pharmacologic agent in a motivationally inappropriate sample may not provide a good estimate of the agent's effectiveness. In view of the important public health role that methadone maintenance programs play in preventing HIV transmission, and the subversion of this role by intravenous cocaine use, solutions to these problems are urgently needed. The authors suggest several possible approaches, including pre- and posttreatment motivation assessment, as well as the inclusion of psychosocial interventions that provide the context for the emergence of potential medication effects.

AB  - This chapter reports the results of a study comparing African-American adolescent (13–18 yr old) crack cocaine users and nonusers in a San Francisco housing project. Interviews with all participants revealed that the long-term quality of family, peer, and community interactions appeared to differentiate crack users from nonusers. For example, before starting crack use, users were more likely to spend time alone or with friends at holidays than with their immediate family; users were also less likely to recall pleasant childhood memories.

AB  - The relationship between addiction severity, psychiatric symptoms, AIDS risk behaviors, and an alternative 5-factor measure of personality, the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire, was assessed in 92 cocaine-misusing pregnant and postpartum women in an inner city outpatient treatment program. 3 of the personality traits (Neuroticism-Anxiety, Impulsive Sensation Seeking, Aggression-Hostility) were significantly related to different subscales of the Addiction Severity Index, the Beck Depression Inventory, various psychiatric symptoms, and high HIV risk sexual activity. Of these traits, Neuroticism-Anxiety seemed to be the most powerful predictor of symptom severity for this sample of women. Scores on the personality dimensions were not related to recency, frequency, amount, or duration of drug use or to treatment outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Endogenous central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) may be involved in the neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to cocaine. In the present study, levels of CRF mRNA were measured in the hypothalamus and in several extrahypothalamic brain regions after different regimens of binge-pattern cocaine administration. Male Fischer rats were injected with saline or cocaine (15 mg/kg, 1 hr × 3/day) at the beginning of the light cycle, to approximate the manner in which cocaine is often abused by humans, both in terms of temporal pattern and in relation to circadian rhythm. These results suggest that the attenuated response in the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis to chronic binge cocaine administration is coupled to the cocaine-induced decreases in CRF gene expression in the hypothalamus and that activation of CRF gene expression in extrahypothalamic regions may have implications for a molecular understanding of the behavioral responses to cocaine.

AB  - A survey of 1,220 street-recruited crack cocaine smokers from Miami, New York, and San Francisco revealed that crack smokers may turn to drug injection to ease crack withdrawal. Crack smokers who later injected tended to smoke crack more heavily and for longer periods than those who did not inject. Data revealed that the initiation of injection was significantly associated with ever snorting heroin or snorting heroin specifically while smoking crack, suggesting that snorted heroin use may mediate the transition to injection among crack smokers. Programs to prevent and treat crack dependence may prevent later injection and injection-related infections including HIV. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Male mice given 5 repeated administrations of methamphetamine (MAP) or cocaine (COC) at 3-day intervals in a round tilting-type activity cage (TAC [20 cm diameter]) showed sensitization to the ambulation-increasing effect of each drug. The mean 3- or 2-hr overall activity count at the 5th administration of MAP or COC, respectively, was 2.3–2.5 times higher than that at the 1st administration. Ss given MAP or COC 4 times in non-tilting round spaces (15–30 cm diameter) exhibited sensitization as strong as that demonstrated by Ss given each drug in the TACs, when Ss were given the 5th administration in the TACs. In contrast, Ss repeatedly given drugs in spaces 4–9 cm or 12 cm in diameter never or only partially, respectively, exhibited sensitization to MAP and COC. Ss given MAP or COC 4 times in their home cages showed partial sensitization. Repeated administration of saline did not cause significant change in sensitivity to either drug.

AB  - Exposure to cocaine during fetal development has been demonstrated to produce a variety of brain and behavioral changes. Cocaine is a potent releaser of a variety of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which act as developmental signals. Since serotonin plays an important role in astroglial maturation, migration, and growth factor production (e.g., S-100β), we proposed that these properties of astroglial cells will be altered in a brain prenatally exposed to cocaine. To observe cocaine's effects on astroglial development, we performed immunocytochemical analyses of a variety of developmental protein markers including BrdU, Gap-43, vimentin, and S-100β. Our results demonstrate that prenatal cocaine administration produces decreased cell proliferation as measured by BrdU staining, retarded neurite outgrowth as ascertained by increased Gap-43 immunoreactivity, increased density of vimentin-positive radial glial cells, and diminished tissue S-100β immunoreactivity. Overall, these results suggest that cocaine delays astroglial development. This delay would have profound effects on neuronal development and outgrowth and, thus, development of the entire brain.

AB  - Attempted to identify patient predictor variables associated with early attrition among 198 cocaine abusers in an outpatient treatment program. Dropouts were more likely to be Black or Hispanic-American, younger, with an earlier onset of substance abuse. Among minorities, those with more education were less likely to drop out. Ss who were less educated and smoked or injected cocaine were particularly prone to discontinue treatment prematurely. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Determined whether initial and weekly marijuana use are predictive of subsequent cocaine use via a discrete-time survival analysis method. Data from an annual national survey among 1,725 11–17 yr olds (as of 1976) from 1977–83, and the 1992 school based Youth Evaluation Study data on about 8,000 grade-, middle- and high school students over a 3-yr period were used. Results show that weekly marijuana use is a strong and independent predictor of initial cocaine use even after an adjustment for other well-known risk factor. This suggests that more intense use of marijuana as opposed to initial experimentation is a stronger predictor. However, the association between weekly marijuana use and cocaine use is, in part, mediated by delinquent attitudes. Thus, weekly marijuana use is a risk factor that is equal to or greater in magnitude than other risk factors for initial cocaine use such as deviant peer bonding and attitudes toward deviance.

AB  - Compared language development profiles of 5 children (aged 2.0 to 2.5 yrs) who were prenatally exposed to cocaine and associated risk factors and with those of 5 matched nonexposed control Ss in terms of discourse-pragmatic, semantic, and form components of language. Language samples from 15 min free- and 15 min structured-play conditions were analyzed based on A. M. Wetherby and C. A. Prutting's (see record [rid]1985-01493-001[/rid]) procedures. The major differences between the S groups were in discourse-pragmatics although less marked differences were found in syntactic development. Results suggest that language development of these children may be vulnerable to disruption. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Hypothesized that a 3-chain sequence of cocaine administration might reinstate the original drug effect (i.e., the drug effects would oscillate). Data indicate that for a wide array of endpoints (including amphetamine-evoked, in vitro striatal dopamine efflux, amphetamine and K+-evoked efflux of heart norepinephrine and nonevoked plasma levels of corticosterone and glucose) repeated, in vivo cocaine (15 mg/kg) administration to male rats precipitated successive oscillations in the magnitude or direction of the organism's responsiveness to subsequent cocaine administration. This capacity of cocaine to produce oscillations in response to successive administrations appears to be due to its foreign/stressful aspect rather than its specific pharmacological properties.

AB  - A short-term prospective design was used to investigate factors associated with the initiation of cocaine use during a 1-year period among a population sample of 942 marijuana users. In addition to demographic items, variables pertaining to various psychosocial characteristics including psychiatric symptoms, personality attributes, social support, and peer pressure were examined. Using cocaine nonusers as a comparison group, male gender, risk-taking tendencies, and socializing with friends on streets or in cars were identified as significant predictors of initiation. Implications for primary prevention programs include redirecting early sensation-seeking tendencies in children and adolescents toward more positive behaviors.

AB  - The validity of an alternative 5-factor measure of personality, the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ), was assessed in 450 cocaine abusers seeking outpatient treatment. As predicted, the ZKPQ Impulsive Sensation Seeking (ImpSS), Neuroticism-Anxiety (N-Anx), and Aggression-Hostility (Agg-Hos) scales were associated with greater drug abuse and psychiatric severity and symptoms and worse outcome (p < .01). The Sociability and Activity scales were not correlated with symptoms or severity. The internal consistency and factor structure of the ZKPQ in this clinical sample was consistent with that found in nonclinical college samples. However, ImpSS, N-Anx, and Agg-Hos were more strongly correlated with each other and grouped together in cluster analyses to define a more severe subtype of cocaine abusers.

AB  - Three experiments investigated the role of endogenous corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in cocaine (COC) withdrawal-induced anxiety. 171 male rats were subjected to chronic COC administration. Ss tested 30 min after the last COC injection did not show withdrawal anxiety on the elevated plus maze or any alterations in brain CRF levels. Withdrawal (48 hrs) from chronic COC administration produced an intense anxiety-like behavior characterized by decreased open arm exploration. Immunoreactive CRF levels were selectively altered in the hypothalamus, in the amygdala, and in the basal forebrain structures at the time of the behavioral anxiety, reflecting an increased activity of brain CRF systems. Daily intracerebroventricular/ly (icv) pretreatment with an immunoserum raised against CRF prevented the development of anxiety induced by COC withdrawal.

AB  - Hypothesized that help seeking for cocaine use is a function of the negative consequences from cocaine, perception of self as dependent upon cocaine, quantity and frequency of use, cost of use, and route of administration. 161 substance abusers (aged 16–58 yrs) in treatment who had used any cocaine in the last 6 mo completed questionnaires on quantity, frequency, history, and perceptions of the consequences of their cocaine use. 113 of the Ss had sought help from someone for their cocaine use. Analysis revealed that the number of negative consequences experienced, feeling dependent on cocaine, and the amount of cocaine used were associated with seeking help for cocaine use. Dependent feelings were associated with number of negative consequences experienced and frequency of use. Results suggest that client's motivation to seek help is related primarily to adverse consequences of use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined conditions associated with episodes in which substance abusers (aged 23–51 yrs) either do or do not use cocaine. 35 cocaine-addicted Ss were interviewed to obtain 2 types of narratives: (1) about using cocaine; and (2) about not using cocaine. These were content analyzed to identify internal and external conditions that were present immediately prior to use or non-use episodes. Prevalent factors in cocaine use were having enough money, wish to end physical/emotional pain, and wish/decision to use. The factors in non-use were Ss arranged conditions to be nonstimulating for using cocaine, recognition of bad consequences, and wish/decision not to use. Ss' wish/decision was an important factor in both conditions. The conditions for use tended to be more external, whereas those for non-use tended to be more internal. Implications for treatment are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Determined the prevalence of cocaine exposure in a rural obstetric sample and examined the relationship between exposure and perinatal variables. Urine was collected from 474 infants admitted to a labor and delivery unit, 100 infants admitted to a well-born nursery unit, and 100 infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit in 1 hospital, and maternal and infant medical records were reviewed. Urine specimens were analyzed for benzoylecgonine, and the Obstetrical Complications Scale was completed for each mother–infant pair. The prevalence of exposure in the 3 groups of infants ranged from 5% to 7%. Despite differences between users and nonusers on some perinatal variables, no single perinatal variable or set of perinatal variables was identified as predictive of infants who might be at high risk for prenatal cocaine exposure.

AB  - Assessed risk factors for HIV-1 among drug injectors (DIs) in Rio de Janeiro, where cocaine is the dominant drug of injection. 123 Ss were recruited at drug abuse treatment sites and street locations. HIV antibody test results were derived from serum tests and self-reports of previous tests. Of 27 Ss with serological and self-reported antibody status data, 20 reported previous negative tests; of these, 3 had positive sera and may have seroconverted. Seven Ss reporting prior positive serostatus and tested positive. For the 123 Ss, seroprevalence was 34%. Multivariate logistic regression identified several significant risk factors: years of injection greater than 5, being a man who has had sex with men in the previous 5 yrs, and not having taken deliberate steps to protect oneself against AIDS. Homosexual/bisexual male DIs may be a bridge group through which HIV is entering drug-injecting networks in Rio de Janeiro. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Pharmacotherapy response was compared in 94 cocaine-abusing methadone patients, 75 with and 19 without antisocial personality disorder (ASP), using desipramine 150 mg daily in 30 Ss, amantadine 300 mg daily in 33 Ss, and placebo in 31 Ss. Retention was lower for the ASP group. During the first 2 wks, there was no significant difference in the percentage of cocaine-free urines between the ASP vs non-ASP Ss, but during the last 2 wks, the non-ASP Ss showed a significantly greater percentage of cocaine-free urines. Placebo-treated Ss demonstrated no significant difference in their urine toxicologies comparing the first to the last 2 wks of treatment. The percentage of cocaine-free urines increased from 15% to 32% in medicated non-ASP Ss but showed no change in medicated ASP Ss. Thus, ASP was a poor prognostic factor for treatment retention and continued cocaine abuse, and medication improved treatment outcome only for the non-ASP Ss.

AB  - Reports an error in 'Protective factors can mitigate behavior problems after prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures' by Henrietta S. Bada, Carla M. Bann, Toni M. Whitaker, Charles R. Bauer, Seetha Shankaran, Linda LaGasse, Barry M. Lester, Jane Hammond and Rosemary Higgins (Pediatrics, 2012[Dec][1], Vol 130[6], e1479-e1488). In the original article, on page e1485, in the first row heading of Table 4, the headings read: 'Variable, Externalizing, Internalizing, Total, Attention, Variable, Externalizing, Internalizing, Total.' These should have read: 'Variable, Externalizing, Internalizing, Total, Attention'. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-20605-004[/rid]). Background: We determined the role of risk and protective factors on the trajectories of behavior problems associated with high prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE)/polydrug exposure. Methods: The Maternal Lifestyle Study enrolled 1388 children with or without PCE, assessed through age 15 years. Because most women using cocaine during pregnancy also used other substances, we analyzed for the effects of 4 categories of prenatal drug exposure: high PCE/other drugs (OD), some PCE/OD, OD/no PCE, and no PCE/no OD. Risks and protective factors at individual, family, and community levels that may be associated with behavior outcomes were entered stepwise into latent growth curve models, then replaced by cumulative risk and protective indexes, and finally by a combination of levels of risk and protective indexes. Main outcome measures were the trajectories of externalizing, internalizing, total behavior, and attention problems scores from the Child Behavior Checklist (parent). Results: A total of 1022 (73.6%) children had known outcomes. High PCE/OD significantly predicted externalizing, total, and attention problems when considering the balance between risk and protective indexes. Some PCE/OD predicted externalizing and attention problems. OD/no PCE also predicted behavior outcomes except for internalizing behavior. High level of protective factors was associated with declining trajectories of problem behavior scores over time, independent of drug exposure and risk index scores. Conclusions: High PCE/OD is a significant risk for behavior problems in adolescence; protective factors may attenuate its detrimental effects. Clinical practice and public health policies should consider enhancing protective factors while minimizing risks to improve outcomes of drug-exposed children.

AB  - Replies to comments made by Byron and Cassel on the original article, 'Binge ethanol administration enhances the MDMA-induced long-term neurotoxicity in rat brain' (see record [rid]2007-00470-006[/rid]). Byron and Cassel have published several studies in which they analyzed some of the behavioral and neurochemical effects induced by the concurrent administration of ethanol and MDMA to rats. As most of the results differed from those reported in our paper, they speculated in their comments about the possible reasons for this discrepancy. Nevertheless, doses of ethanol and MDMA, experimental design, ambient temperature, and strain are so different that what is really difficult is to find some common point between the studies carried out by the two groups.

AB  - 58 African-American male and female adolescents (aged 13–18 yrs) were recruited by street outreach in San Francisco. By self-report, 22 were crack users; 36 were noncrack users. What appeared to distinguish noncrack users from crack users prior to their drug use was the long-term quality of family, peer, and community interactions. Before initiating crack use, users were more likely to spend holidays alone or with friends than with their immediate or extended family. Users were less likely to recall pleasant childhood memories and were more likely to have begun sex with casual rather than steady partners.

AB  - Investigated whether there was a difference in developmental experiences between 40 postpartum women who had used cocaine (CC) during pregnancy and 40 who had not. Ss completed a retrospective structured interview examining adaptive functioning, drug use patterns, and selected risk factors for adult substance abuse encountered before age 16. Ss who used CC had significantly higher past and present use of a broad range of drugs, particularly crack and other forms of CC, as well as lower levels of general adaptive functioning. CC users showed elevated scores on measures of developmental risk factors for adult substance use, including having been physically or sexually abused and having had a primary caregiver who abused substances.

AB  - Estimated the degree to which the risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) might be elevated among adults actively using cocaine (CA), with and without illicit use of marijuana (MJ). Using data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area surveys, 13,306 at-risk participants were identified, 414 being active CA users. There were 105 incident cases of OCD and 514 Ss who had not developed OCD. Conditional multiple logistic regression (MLR) was used to estimate the risk of OCD for active CA users vs nonusers. Unconditional MLR was used to estimate OCD risk for the 414 active CA users vs the 12,892 participants not using CA. Ss actively using CA and MJ had a higher risk for OCD. Under the conditional model the risk was 7.2; under the unconditional model the risk was 4.1. Active users of CA were almost always active users of MJ or some other substance.

AB  - Illustrates a method to implement the constraints of stationarity and invariance of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) factor scores. As part of a National Institute on Drug Abuse grant-funded, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess effectiveness of treating 54 cocaine-abusing patients (mean age 33.9 yrs) with fluoxetine, POMS data were collected at baseline and at 6 wks. Data were also collected for 36 controls. Based on the absolute fit indices, the model fits to the data were marginal at best. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Explored some of the psychological reasons for ingestion of LSD by interviewing 37 Harvard and Radcliffe undergraduates. Many of those interviewed were seen as patients in the university health services. Reasons for initial use were given as follows: (a) poor relationships with other people and a desire to improve them; (b) extreme dissatisfaction with self, characterized by high expectations and poor performance; (c) alienation from and hostility to the adult world; (d) feelings of inadequacy; and (e) a strong sense of moral worthlessness and a desire to feel some religious experience. The majority of the Ss discontinued use of the drug after relatively few experiences with it, mainly because of the failure of LSD to meet their expectations and its inconsistency in providing the desired mood alteration. Frequently students later turned to other types of drugs, primarily marihuana and 'downers.' (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 12 adult males rats were administered cocaine (50.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally [ip]) daily for 7 days in a Pavlovian paradigm either immediately prior (paired group) or 30 min following (unpaired group) a 20-min placement in an open-field test environment. After 7 days of drug withdrawal, Ss were retested 3 days apart, once with saline and once with cocaine (50 mg/kg). Measurement of locomotion as distance traversed revealed a higher level of locomotion in the paired group on all test trials. Analysis indicates an antihabituation effect of cocaine rather than a hyperlocomotion or a conditioned locomotor effect. Rotation pattern analysis for each S showed a new frequency distribution of rotations across 4 categories of diameter size in the paired but not in the unpaired group by Day 5.

AB  - Investigated the role of endogenous corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in cocaine (COC)-induced locomotor hyperactivity in 515 male rats. Such hyperactivity was inhibited by intracerebroventricular/ly (icv) pretreatment with CRF antiserum and αh-CRF, a modified fragment of CRF with an antagonistic property suggesting the role of endogenous CRF. These results are consistent with a proposed role of CRF in COC-induced anxiety in COC abusers, raising the possibility of the potential use of CRF antagonists in the treatment of COC withdrawal anxiety in humans.

AB  - Conducted a retrospective study of 116 hospitalized psychiatric patients treated with neuroleptic drugs to determine factors associated with acute dystonic reactions (ADRs). 19 of 45 cocaine users and 10 of 71 nonusers developed dystonic reactions during hospitalization. All 5 patients with multiple episodes of ADRs used cocaine. Neuroleptic dose but not potency was associated with increased risk for ADR. Overall, data suggest that cocaine is a powerful risk factor for neuroleptic-related ADR. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined whether clinical and demographic variables of early dropouts significantly differ from those of completers. Of 60 adult cocaine misusers seeking outpatient treatment, 33 (55%) dropped out by 4 wks. Dropouts were more likely to be male, to be Black or Hispanic, and to have no history of primary depression. Data suggest that completer status is determined by a complex interactive effect of clinical, programmatic, and sociodemographic variables.

AB  - Compared the pharmacotherapy response in 20 depressed and 74 nondepressed cocaine (COC) abusers on methadone maintenance in a 12-wk, randomized, double-blind trial using amantadine, desipramine, and placebo. The depressed Ss had poorer retention (67% vs 92%), a lesser decrease in amount of money spent on COC usage (17% vs 43%), stronger depressive symptoms, and far fewer instances of COC-free urine (0% vs 32%). Depression is an important prognostic factor in the treatment of methadone-maintained patients who are COC abusers, and there may be an important role for pharmacotherapy in treating this subgroup of depressed patients.

AB  - Reviews the article, Psychosocial and behavioral factors related to the postpartum placements of infants born to cocaine-using women by S. Minnes, L. T. Singer, R. Humphrey-Wall, and S. Satayathum (see record [rid]2008-04413-005[/rid]). This study examined the characteristics among cocaine-using women who maintained custody of their newborns and cocaine-using women whose infants were removed from their custody. It also explored the extent to which maternal psychosocial characteristics contributed to child placement. The authors hypothesized that women who lost custody of their newborns would report greater levels of psychological distress, more violent relationships, maladaptive coping skills, decreased social support, and higher rates of childhood trauma. It was also believed that heavy prenatal cocaine use and severe psychological distress would increase the probability of child placement. Findings evidenced a correlation between 3 maternal characteristics and loss of custody among cocaine-using mothers. The authors suggest that women who use cocaine prenatally and who lose custody of their children are at increased risk for heavy cocaine use, severe psychological distress, and typically have a history of emotional neglect. They emphasize the importance of early assessment and intervention for these women and their infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse established a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for 35 adult crack cocaine smokers who relapsed after hospital detoxification and returned a 2nd time. Major findings are that relapse followed a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involved narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involved multideterminants. Two case examples, involving a 30-yr-old Black male and a 35-yr-old Black female, illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Epidemiological evidence regarding the impact of drugs of abuse on HIV disease is mixed but points to a likely association between cocaine use (by different routes) and acquisition of either HIV infection or an AIDS-defining illness. In vitro studies indicate that cocaine increases replication of HIV in both stimulated and unstimulated human peripheral blood monocytes. Recent studies using the huPBL SCID mouse model demonstrate that systemic exposure to cocaine enhances HIV replication and spread in vivo. The huPBL SCID mouse and SCID-hu mouse provide potentially useful models for evaluating the impact of other drugs of abuse on HIV infection and the mechanisms mediating these effects.

AB  - Reply by the current author to the comments made by Jianjun Yang et al. (see record [rid]2012-03893-022[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2011-07656-013[/rid]). The authors suggest the possibility that α- amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor participates in the mediation of the increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor observed in chronic ketamine users. The fact that increased intracellular glutamate release may activate AMPA receptor and this, in turn, may upregulate brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression is certainly a plausible hypothesis and is not in contrast with our interpretation. The authors themselves acknowledge that the possibility that glutamate activates AMPA instead of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is caused by or linked to ketamine’s antagonist action at NMDA receptor which we proposed as the basic mechanism. The activation of AMPA receptors plasticity pathways has also been proposed to play a critical role in ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effect. These rapid effects on depressive symptoms seem to take place through a direct trafficking of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. Thus, we believe that the mechanism suggested by the authors is a valid compelling hypothesis to the interpretation of our data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by V. Ricci et al. (see record [rid]2011-07656-013[/rid]). Ricci et al. considered that the mechanism underlying the increased serum levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in chronic ketamine use are attributed to the antagonistic action of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. receptor. However, the intracellular glutamate release increased by ketamine administration preferentially favors α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor over NMDA receptor because the latter is occupied by ketamine. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that AMPA receptor mediates the increase of BDNF via two distinct signaling pathways. The first pathway involves the increases in intracellular calcium concentration, which subsequently leads to the upregulation of BDNF gene expression through calcium response elements. The second pathway depends on the activation of Lyn, a member of the src family of protein tyrosine kinases, which upregulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and then leads to the increases of BDNF expression.

AB  - This study examined Ecstasy use in 322 young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 years who participated in an Internet study regarding their history of substance use. The primary goal of this study was to increase our understanding of what factors differentiate between different 'types' of Ecstasy users. Specifically, this study examined potential factors that distinguish between young adults who experiment with the use of Ecstasy and then quit ('Experimenters'); become active users of Ecstasy and continue use ('Users'); and become active users of Ecstasy and then quit ('Quitters'). In addition, a non-ecstasy using polydrug using group served as a 'Control' group. The following primary outcome variables were examined: age of first use of Ecstasy; patterns of Ecstasy consumption; Ecstasy use by peers; levels of social conformity, sensation seeking, risk appraisal, and risky behaviors; motivations for initial use of Ecstasy; motivations for continued use of Ecstasy; psychological addiction to Ecstasy; testing of Ecstasy pills; use of 5-HTP and vitamins; reasons reported by non-Ecstasy users for lack of experimentation with Ecstasy; and, general knowledge and beliefs about Ecstasy. Results indicated that Ecstasy Users (Experimenters, Users, and Quitters) were similar in the following characteristics: history of polydrug use; social conformity; sensation-seeking; appraisal of risky activities; history of engaging in risky activities; and self-report of reasons for first using Ecstasy. In addition, findings revealed the following characteristics to be distinguishing factors among the three groups (Users, Experimenters, and Quitters): extent of polydrug use; age of first use of ecstasy; patterns of ecstasy use; number of peers who currently use Ecstasy; and reasons for continued use of ecstasy. Notably, all of the participants in this study self-reported polydrug use, and Users were found to be significantly more likely to report having used a greater number of substances during the past 90 days than Experimenters, Quitters, and Controls. Furthermore, results suggest that young adults who have peers who use Ecstasy are at great risk for either the initiation of or continuation of current Ecstasy use. Implications for prevention and intervention are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Accumulating evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies suggests that women may have a greater biological vulnerability to cocaine addiction than males. Studying behavioral, neurochemical, neurobiological or physiological trait and state variables may provide some insight into individual difference leading to high risk for drug abuse. The research described in this dissertation was designed to examine a number of trait and state markers associated with social hierarchy in female nonhuman primates. In addition, the effect of menstrual cycle phase and social rank was examined on acquisition and maintenance of cocaine reinforcement. Chapter II was aimed at examining physiological, neurochemical, neuropharmacological and behavioral variables that may be associated with social rank. The two measures that correlated with social rank were cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of the 5-HT metabolite 5-HIAA, which were significantly higher in the animals that eventually became subordinate and latency to touch a novel object, which was significantly lower in eventual subordinate monkeys. Age, body weight, locomotor activity in a novel environment, HPA-axis function and peripheral serotonin (5-HT) activity, as measured in blood and central 5-HT activity, as measured with brain imaging, did not predict social rank and did not change after stable social group formations. These data suggest that levels of central 5-HIAA and measures of novel object reactivity may be trait markers that influence eventual social rank in female macaques. The studies in Chapter III examined the influence of social rank and menstrual cycle phase on acquisition and maintenance of cocaine self-administration in socially housed female monkeys. Dominant monkeys appeared more sensitive to the reinforcing effects of cocaine, with over 60% acquiring self-administration at the lowest dose (0.001 mg/kg) compared to ∼ 20% subordinate monkeys. At higher cocaine doses, there were no differences in rates of acquisition. In maintenance, the peak of the cocaine dose-response curve for dominant monkeys was to the left of those for subordinate monkeys. Finally, menstrual cycle phase did not affect cocaine sensitivity in dominant or subordinate monkeys. These studies are at odds with earlier work in male monkeys and suggest that dominant female monkeys are more vulnerable to cocaine reinforcement than subordinate monkeys. These findings highlight the importance of sex differences in animal models of cocaine abuse. In conclusion, the research presented in this dissertation further extends our understanding of the neurobiological and behavioral underpinnings of social rank and cocaine reinforcement and extends the work to female monkeys. The findings suggest a gender-specific 'vulnerable' phenotype for cocaine reinforcement. Further studies of social rank-related differences in neurobiology and other individual traits are warranted to better understand vulnerability to drug abuse in females which could lead to identification of potential new targets for pharmacological and behavioral therapies of cocaine abuse.

AB  - In rats, intake of an otherwise normally preferred saccharin solution is reduced when presentation of the saccharin solution is repeatedly followed by the administration of a drug of abuse, such as morphine, heroin, or cocaine. Recent data suggest that avoidance of the taste cue occurs because the rewarding properties of the saccharin are devalued in anticipation of the availability of the more rewarding drug of abuse. This ‘reward comparison’ paradigm serves as the first and only model of devaluation of natural rewards by drugs of abuse. Interestingly, while drug-induced suppression of saccharin intake is a robust phenomenon, clear individual differences have emerged. Indeed, approximately half of the Sprague-Dawley rats greatly avoid intake of the saccharin cue following taste-drug pairings (referred to as the large suppressers), while the other half of the rats (referred to as the small suppressers) do not. In addition, greater avoidance of the saccharin cue by the large suppressers is associated with greater saccharin cue induced elevations in circulating corticosterone (CORT) at test and, importantly, with greater cocaine self-administration behavior, as well. Although it is clear that humans also exhibit individual differences in the susceptibility to drug-taking behavior, it is not clear what mediates these differences in behavior or what factors contribute to the transition from recreational use to addiction. It is possible that individual vulnerability to addiction is mediated, in part, by greater drug craving or withdrawal when presented with conditioned drug cues. In the present paradigm, it is hypothesized that greater avoidance of the saccharin cue reflects better learning of the taste cue-drug association and this learning is facilitated by increased circulating levels of CORT. The present set of experiments addressed this hypothesis by employing behavioral and genetic methods to examine the nature of the differences observed in the large and small suppressers. The first few sets of experiments were designed not only to evaluate the nature of the CORT response in the phenomenon but also to determine whether the unconditioned CORT response to cocaine can predict which rats will go on to become large or small suppressers. The results of these experiments support the conclusion that greater elevations in both the conditioned and uncondtioned CORT response are associated not only with greater cocaine self-administration behavior but also with greater suppression in saccharin intake. Thus, higher levels of circulating CORT result in being more prone to drug-taking behavior and subsequent devaluation of a naturally rewarding saccharin solution. In a separate experiment, the general preference for sweets was tested for its predictive value in our paradigm. Greater intake of sucrose, however, was not associated with greater cocaine-induced avoidance of saccharin intake. The second set of experiments was designed to determine the extent to which genetic background would influence responsiveness to cocaine and subsequent devaluation of the saccharin reward. The results of a three generation selective breeding study revealed significant differences in the large and small suppresser lines by the second generation, suggesting that genetic makeup alone can influence behavior in the reward comparison paradigm. This conclusion was supported by the results of the final experiment that tested several inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6Ibg, DBA/2Ibg, and Sv129Ibg) in the reward comparison model that revealed significant strain differences in saccharin intake behavior. Taken together, these findings support that individual differences in cocaine-induced avoidance of saccharin intake are mediated by differences in genetic makeup, CORT, and learning (i.e., conditioning). Implications of these findings for drug addiction are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Drug tolerance, a loss of drug effect relative to initial impact, is a common outcome of effects of repeated cocaine administration on operant behavior in humans and nonhumans. Previous research with rats and monkeys has shown that tolerance to behavioral effects of cocaine develops if the drug is administered before behavioral test sessions but does not if it is administered after sessions, an outcome which is referred to as contingent tolerance. Many experiments have found contingent tolerance, except a recent experiment using pigeons. The results of that study suggested that pigeons might develop tolerance to effects of cocaine regardless of whether the drug was administered before or after behavioral test sessions. The current set of experiments focused on environmental and pharmacological factors in the development of contingent tolerance to cocaine in pigeons by examining various relations between time of drug administration and the conduct of behavioral test sessions. Experiment 1 examined if cocaine administered immediately before or immediately after the behavioral session led to the development of tolerance to effects of cocaine during the behavioral session. The results showed that pre-session administration of cocaine reliably led to tolerance, and post-session administration of cocaine led to tolerance in half the subjects. Experiment 2 examined whether eating under effects of cocaine in the home cage, which occurs if the drug is given post session, contributed to the development of tolerance to effects of cocaine on key pecking during the behavioral session. In this experiment, some subjects were administered cocaine after the behavioral session and immediately before being fed their post-session food ration, and other subjects were fed their post-session food ration immediately after the session and were administered cocaine one hour later. Results of Experiment 2 found that eating in the home cage under the effects of cocaine was not necessary for tolerance to develop to effects of cocaine during the behavioral session, and that the majority of subjects developed tolerance from post-session cocaine administration. Experiment 3 examined whether mere exposure to cocaine in the home cage without exposure to an experimental session led to tolerance to effects of cocaine during a behavioral session. Mere drug exposure did not reliably produce tolerance during the behavioral session. Experiment 4 examined if daily cocaine administration during dose-response curve redetermination was necessary for tolerance to develop. The results showed that tolerance from post-session cocaine administration was readily observed even when chronic dosing was discontinued during dose-response curve assessment. Therefore, the combined results showed that pigeons often develop tolerance to effects of cocaine during the behavioral session when cocaine is administered post-session. Some aspect of exposure to the experimental session or experimental context on a regular basis was necessary for tolerance to develop, yet this exposure did not have to occur while subjects were under effects of the drug. These results indicate that not-contingent tolerance may be common in pigeons, and therefore questions the generality of contingent tolerance to cocaine.

AB  - Epidemiological data suggest that 50-90% of cocaine users choose to co-administer ethanol during binges. This thesis proposes that these statistics stem not from an enhanced reward produced by the additive effects of the two drugs, but rather, that ethanol serves to attenuate the delayed negative side-effects of cocaine administration. In the introductory chapter, three theories are described to account for the co-administration of cocaine and ethanol: negative reinforcement theory, positive reinforcement theory and the opponent-process theory. The first experiment, described in Chapter 2, revealed that animals consuming oral ethanol soon after traversing a straight alley for daily intravenous cocaine injections behaved in a manner suggestive that the drug acts to reduce post-cocaine anxiety. Chapter 3 discusses our use of the conditioned place preference method to determine whether a cocaine metabolite that is formed only in the presence of ethanol, cocaethylene, might some how account for the alcohol + cocaine results. In Chapter 4, we determined that rats, like humans, voluntarily chose to consume alcohol if they've been pretreated with cocaine. Only very low levels of cocaethylene were produced in subjects administered both cocaine and ethanol, indicating that this metabolite probably did not influence the behavior of subjects in the first two studies. The final study (Chapter 5) found that oral ethanol ameliorated the place aversion normally produced for an environment paired with the effects of intravenous cocaine present 15 minutes post-injection. However, this may be explained by the alteration in cocaine metabolism that occurs after ethanol pre-exposure. Combined, the results of these experiments suggest that the motivation of subjects to combine cocaine and ethanol largely stems from the ability of ethanol to reduce the negative/anxiogenic component of the cocaine experience.

AB  - Stress contributes to drug addiction, and footshock has been used to study effects of stress on aspects of cocaine-motivated behaviour. However, the effects of acute footshock on the efficacy of cocaine reinforcement have not previously been studied. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a neuropeptide known to mediate stress responses. CRF is also important for the effects of stress on aspects of cocaine-motivated behaviour, and for some of the effects of cocaine itself. These findings suggest that CRF could mediate alterations to the efficacy of cocaine reinforcement caused by footshock. Progressive-ratio cocaine self-administration was employed to examine the acute motivational consequences of footshock, and to test the hypothesis that brain CRF mediates these effects. Initial experiments examined behavioural changes produced by intermittent, non-contingent footshock applied to rats during self-administration sessions. Results showed that footshock altered break points for iv cocaine in a manner that depended on footshock intensity (0-2 mA) and duration (0-4.5 s): increases in intensity produced asymptotic increases in break point; increases in duration produced biphasic, inverted-U shaped effects on break point. Footshock also increased inactive lever responding and reinforcement rate. In contrast with the effects on cocaine reinforcement, footshock did not alter break points for sucrose. The role of CRF was tested using in vivo microdialysis to measure changes in nucleus accumbens neurochemistry following intracerebroventricular CRF infusions. Results indicated that CRF dose-dependently enhanced dopamine metabolites. In separate experiments the motivational consequences of CRF were tested directly, using either cocaine or sucrose reinforcement. The self-administration results showed that CRF (10 mu;g) attenuated break points for iv cocaine, but did not alter break points for sucrose. A final experiment tested the effects of intracerebroventricular infusions of alpha-helical CRF9-41 a non-selective CRF antagonist, on footshock-induced changes to progressive-ratio cocaine self-administration. The antagonist selectively reversed the descending portion of the inverted-U shaped effects of footshock on break points for cocaine. Together, these findings indicate that intermittent, non-contingent footshock can both facilitate and suppress ongoing cocaine-motivated behaviour, depending on the duration of footshock stimuli applied. CRF was implicated in the suppressing but not the facilitating effects of footshock on progressive-ratio cocaine self-administration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The primary objective of the present thesis was to characterize the role of two neurobiological systems, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and noradrenaline (NE), in stress- and cocaine-induced relapse to cocaine seeking, using an animal model of relapse. Rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) for 3 hours daily for 10-14 days and were then put on an extinction schedule during which lever pressing was no longer reinforced. Tests for reinstatement were given after intermittent electric footshock (10 or 15 min; 0.5-0.8 mA) and after priming injections of saline and cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.).  In a first series of experiments, footshock reinstated cocaine seeking in both intact animals and in animals given corticosterone replacement, but not in adrenalectomized animals. Intracerebroventricular injections of the CRF-receptor antagonist, D-Phe CRF12-41, blocked footshock-induced reinstatement in both intact animals and animals given corticosterone replacement. Reinstatement by priming injections of cocaine was only minimally attenuated by adrenalectomy and by pretreatment with D-Phe CRF12-41. Additionally, systemic injections of the non-peptide CRF-receptor antagonist, CP-154,526, blocked the footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CRF acting directly in the brain and independent of the hypothalarnic-pituitary-adrenal axis mediates the stress- but not cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. In an attempt to localize where in the brain CRF acts to initiate the behaviors involved in relapse, injections of D-Phe CRF12-41 were made into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the amygdala (AMG), two sites that contain CRF receptors and that have been implicated in behavioral and physiological effects of stress. Injections into the BNST, but not the AMG, blocked the footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking and injections of CRF into the BNST, but not the AMG, were sufficient to induce reinstatement. These results suggest that the BNST is an import site of action for CRF in mediating the effects of footshock on relapse.  In a second series of experiments, an important role for NE in stress-induced relapse was demonstrated. Systemic injections of three alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, and gunabenz), which act to block NE cell firing and release, blocked footshock-induced relapse but were without effect on relapse induced by priming injections of cocaine. Together with results of the first series of experiments, these data suggest that an interaction between CRF and NE systems, possibly within the extended AMG, underlies the footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Additionally, the findings argue in favor of a view that different neurobiological systems underlie footshock- and drug-induced relapse to drug seeking and that, therefore, different treatment interventions may be required under different circumstances.

AB  - According to the national estimates of women across socioeconomic groups, cocaine use during pregnancy affects between 10 and 20% of all children (Chasnoff, Landress & Barrett, 1990). With the growing number of children exposed to cocaine there has been a number of research studies focused on the potential developmental risks from prenatal cocaine-exposure. The results of these studies have been inconsistent and inconclusive due in part to the number of methodological difficulties encountered when investigating this population. There remains many unanswered questions regarding the overall development of children with prenatal cocaine-exposure. The purpose of this study was to provide descriptive information regarding early play development in a group of children with prenatal cocaine-exposure and associated risk factors. Their performance will be compared to an age matched control group from the same community with no history of drug exposure. The play assessment was based on a 20-minute sample of free play. The results suggest differences between the two groups as well as differences with the cocaine-exposed group. The major differences between the two groups were in the maturity of the play and the initiation of the play activities. The contribution of the multiple risk factors in the cocaine-exposed group will be discussed in relation to these results. The findings from this study suggest that play development may be disrupted in children with cocaine-exposure and associated risk factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The objective of the study was to examine the relative effect of prenatal cocaine exposure, when considered in combination with postnatal caregiver functioning, on the behavioral health outcomes of 3-year-old, full-term, African American children. 196 mother-child dyads who were classified as either cocaine/polydrug-exposed, polydrug/noncocaine-exposed or nondrug-exposed were enrolled prospectively at birth into a longitudinal study of neurodevelopmental outcomes among in utero cocaine-exposed children. Main hypotheses were as follows: (1) severity of prenatal substance exposure will predict child behavioral and emotional adaptation at age three years, (2) maternal psychological functioning, maternal drug use in the last twelve months, and mother-child affective/behavioral interactions will predict child behavioral and emotional adaptation at age three years, and (3) severity of prenatal substance exposure will continue to predict child behavioral and emotional adaptation at age three years after maternal psychological functioning, drug use in the last twelve months, and mother-child affective/behavioral interactions are taken into account. Primary results indicated that the severity of prenatal cocaine/polydrug exposure, severity of maternal drug use in the last year, and mother-child affective/behavioral interactions were unrelated to children's behavioral and emotional adaptation. Maternal psychological functioning predicted children's externalizing symptoms, and the combination of maternal psychological functioning and maternal education attainment predicted children's internalizing symptoms. Overall, results suggested that maternal psychological functioning was the best predictor of children's emotional and behavioral adjustment in this cohort of children. Results may be explained by shared genetic background, perceptual bias among mothers with psychological symptomatology, or psychological symptomatology serving as a marker of maternal drug addiction.

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the relationship between key psychosocial and behavioral components of the Transtheoretical Model and the Theory of Reasoned Action for sexual risk reduction in a population of crack cocaine smokers and sex workers, not in drug treatment. The first study examined the results of an analysis of the association between two principal constructs in the Transtheoretical Model, the processes of change and the stages of change for condom use, in a high risk population. In the analysis of variance for all respondents, the overall F-test revealed that people in different stages have different levels of experiential process use, F(3,317) = 17.79, p = 0.0001 and different levels of behavioral process use, F(3,317) = 28.59, p =.0001. For the experiential processes, there was a significant difference between the precontemplation/contemplation stage, and both the action, and maintenance, stages. The second study explored the relationship between the Theory of Reasoned Action 'beliefs' and the stages-of-change in the same population. In the analysis of variance for all participants, the results indicate that people in different stages did value the positive beliefs differently, F(3,502) = 15.38, p =.0001 but did not value the negative beliefs differently, F(3,502) = 2.08, p =.10. The third study explored differences in stage-of-change by gender, partner type drug use, and HIV status. Three discriminant functions emerged, with a combined 2(12) = 139.57, p = <.0001. The loading matrix of correlations between predictors and discriminant functions demonstrate that the strongest predictor for distinguishing between the precontemplation/contemplation stage and the preparation, action, and maintenance stages (first function) is partner type (.962). The loadings on the second discriminant function suggest that once partner type has been accounted for, ever having HIV/AIDS (.935) was the best predictor for distinguishing between the first three stages and the maintenance stage. These studies demonstrate that behavioral change theories can contribute important insight to researchers and program planners attempting to alter HIV risk behavior in high-risk populations.

AB  - This study used qualitative methods to investigate factors associated with a high level of functioning in people who use cocaine. Ten subjects, seven women and three men, were interviewed. Each subject was referred to the study by a person who thought the subject functioned at a high level. The subjects also completed the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) (McLellan et al., 1992) assessment and evaluation instrument. The factors identified by the subjects were similar to those found by Ditton et al. (1991), that is, people who use cocaine can be middle class, with all the social and economic problems of the general population and also share the same values as the general population. However this study expanded on the findings of Ditton et al. and added the area of awareness of drawbacks of cocaine use. Factors that the subjects associated with a high level of functioning were identified. The use of non-captive populations to study cocaine use was explored. Implications of the study and recommendations for future research in this field are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study was designed to assess the relationship of selected factors to the developmental outcome of fundamental motor skill performance in young children ages 3 to 6 years residing in foster or adoptive care, and have a documented history of prenatal exposure to cocaine and other drugs. Using an ecological theory of child development and the person-process-context model, the study focused on the child's development in selected gross motor skills. Through multiple regression analysis, the study considered the contributions of the following on motor skill performance as measured by the Test of Gross Motor Development: child effortful control as measured by the Children's Behavior Questionnaire, the nonbiological mother's parental attitude as measured by the adapted Parent Attitude Survey, the amount of early intervention services as recorded in the child's medical chart. Participants included 28 children (15 males and 13 females) and their foster or adoptive mother. There is suggestive but inconclusive evidence for the hypothesis that fundamental motor skill performance is predicted by the interaction of the child's effortful control, the nonbiological mother's understanding and confidence, and the amount of early intervention service the child received, [ F (7, 20) = 2.24, p < 0.07 ] . Trends in the data suggest gross motor performance increases with high levels of early intervention, given children with low effortful control and low levels of parental confidence and understanding. In addition, early gross motor scores did not predict fundamental motor skills, r =.10. Despite a 38% rate of identified early gross motor delay, no child was delayed in fundamental motor skill at ages 3 to 6 years. Fundamental motor skill performance ranged from average to superior, M = 121.54. Motor performance was assessed in a clinical setting and caution is recommended when considering skill performance within group settings. Based on this study, children with prenatal exposure to cocaine/polydrugs are viewed as variable in temperamental control and gross motor performance, but perform at an average to above average level in gross motor skill. Further research is needed to validate trends, specifically regarding the interactive effects of child effortful control, parental attitude, and the amount of early intervention service received.

AB  - Heterogeneity of high affinity LSD-binding sites was confirmed by displacement studies with 2-bromo(+)-LSD and with apamin, a peptide neurotoxin, in tissues of adult Sprague-Dawley rats. In line with the concept of multiple binding sites, a number of fractions of putative endogenous ligands could be separated from brain extract. The LSD-displacing beta-fraction was not detectable in tissues lacking high affinity LSD-binding sites. High affinity dopamine- and serotonin-binding was differentially affected by the beta-fraction.

AB  - In human cerebrospinal fluid, substances were detected that were capable of reversibly displacing LSD from its high-affinity binding sites in neuronal membranes. The sites may represent a specific type of LSD-serotonin receptor protein. LSD-displacing factors (LDF) occur physiologically in concentrations high enough to interact with the putative LSD-serotonin receptors. LDF was found to be clearly different from endogenous indoleamine ligands such as serotonin. LDF concentration was assayed in the cerebrospinal fluid of 49 nonpsychotic and 19 acute psychotic patients before 30 days' therapy with the antipsychotic drugs haloperidol or clozapine. LDF concentration was significantly higher in the unmedicated acute psychotic patients (5.55 U/ml) in comparison to the controls (3.56 U/ml). Within the psychotics, high positive correlation was found between concentration of LDF and clinical improvement. Thus, a nosological subgroup was traced out, characterized by both higher concentration of LDF and significantly higher responsiveness to antipsychotic drugs. Ratings of clinical improvement and determinations of LDF before drug therapy were performed in a double-blind study. Since antipsychotic drugs act on dopamine receptors and LDF acts on putative serotonin receptors, dopamine and serotonin receptors may both be affected in the psychotic state.

AB  - Trained 24 male albino Sprague-Dawley rats to discriminate each of 3 doses of LSD (0.02, 0.08, or 0.32 mg/kg) from saline. A progressively altering dose ('fading') method was used in a leverpressing chamber. Dose–response tests revealed that the 3 LSD cues were specific to the dose used during training and that, as the training dose declined, the slope of the LSD dose–response curve became less steep. Substitution tests with direct serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) agonists indicate that 5-HT is involved in mediating the in vivo effects of LSD and that the training dose codetermines substitution or antagonism. Results also indicate that dopamine agonists produce a qualitatively different stimulus from that produced by LSD. (29 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The cocaine epidemic has increased the need for drug treatment programs which address the needs of cocaine users from diverse cultural groups and socioeconomic levels. This study examined the impact of race, socio-economic status (SES), formal education level, and sexual orientation on outcome of Neurobehavioral treatment for cocaine addiction at the Matrix Center. Data from 89 client charts and 77 follow-up phone interviews were used to measure abstinence rates, program retention, treatment satisfaction, desired services, and the client-therapist relationship. Hypothesis testing analyses indicated that cultural factors did not significantly effect overall treatment outcome. Post-hoc analyses showed higher SES subjects to be more successful in maintaining abstinence during treatment, while low SES subjects reported higher abstinence rates at follow-up. Homosexual and bisexual subjects reported less satisfaction with treatment and with their counselors, and reported lower abstinence rates at follow-up than heterosexual subjects. Despite lack of differences in outcome, African American and Latino clients offered suggestions about ways the program could be modified to better meet their needs.

AB  - Examined the latent structure of self-reported cocaine reactions among 103 social-recreational users (aged 21–43 yrs). From a set of 24 items, factor analysis yielded 7 distinct factors: minor reactions consistent with intranasal administration, sensory-perceptual distortions, stimulatory-insomnious effects, paranoic-aggressive reactions, positive social effects, physiological-cardiovascular reactions, and chronic physical-psychological problems.

AB  - Reviews epidemiological studies of adolescent cocaine use and discusses risk factors for use. It is argued that cocaine use among adolescents is increasing due to lower prices and the availability of crack, a potent smokable form of freebase cocaine. It is noted that most use ends after mild to moderate experimentation, but that some users develop severe adverse consequences after a short time. Risk factors for initial cocaine use previously indicated are male gender, use of marihuana, lack of social connections to family and school, peer influences, and psychopathology. It is suggested that prevention efforts should target high-risk preadolescents and involve parents, educators, and health care providers to provide a consistent message in the home, school, and media.

AB  - Trained 16 male Wistar rats to discriminate 10 mg/kg of cocaine (CC) from saline in a 2-lever operant procedure and then retrained them on progressively smaller doses of the training drug. Stimulus generalization experiments with test doses of CC ½—1⁄₂₅₀ times the training dose (TD) were carried out each time Ss had reached criterion on successive TDs. The smallest TD of CC at which Ss reached criterion ranged from 0.31 to 2.5 mg/kg, the median being 0.66 mg/kg. The effects of the TD on the generalization gradient for CC could be related to the relative discriminability of that dose. It is suggested, however, that other effects of CC add to the general effects of the TD in determining the slope of the gradient and the effective dose (ED₅₀) of the training drug. The 2.5 mg/kg TD of CC may perhaps yield better pharmacological specificity than any dose in the 0.16–20 mg/kg range examined here; at this dose, the gradient's slope was steepest and the ratio of TD to ED₅₀ was minimal. The potency difference between apomorphine and CC in generalizing with the CC TD was 17-fold at 2.5 mg/kg but only 3-fold at the 10 mg/kg TD of CC. Data are consistent with the conclusion that the TD has important effects on the stimulus generalizations that may occur following drug–saline discrimination training. However, a comparison between CC and fentanyl revealed that these effects were not identical across training drugs. (15 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Discusses demographic and diagnostic factors in the abuse of cocaine by opioid addicts, including extent of abuse, relationship of cocaine abuse to polydrug abuse, demographic characteristics, antisocial indices, and various personality disorders found in addicts. 533 opioid addicts (mean age 27 yrs) in treatment were evaluated over a 2-day period. 66% of the Ss abused cocaine, which was the 2nd most abused nonopioid drug after marihuana. Abuse was associated with a variety of antisocial indices, including antisocial personality disorder, number of arrests, and legal problems. A higher overall incidence of abuse was found among Blacks, and a higher rate of anxiety disorders was found among Whites. Treatment guidelines are described.

AB  - Compared 95 cocaine users in drug treatment programs to 75 cocaine users not in treatment to examine level of cocaine use, consequences of use, social support resources, and criminal behavior. Results indicate that these attributes were related to being in treatment. Among intermediate-level cocaine users, friendship patterns, employment, and criminal history were associated with treatment status. Treatment Ss were more likely than nontreatment clients to have been (1) heavy users of cocaine, (2) affected by negative consequences of use, (3) unemployed for a longer period of time, (4) without support networks of close friends, (5) dependent upon an illegal activity for their major source of income, and (6) arrested and arrested more often.

AB  - Evaluated age-related effects on cocaine-induced behavior (CIB) following acute and chronic administration of drug (40 mg/kg/day, ip) in 3 groups of 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats representing increasing weights and ages. Three parameters of CIB, rated for 150 min during and following a 14-day treatment period, were measured: (a) latency of onset, (b) maximum level, and (c) duration of effect. Results indicate that initially, the duration of CIB was significantly longer in the oldest, heaviest group. Decreases in latency of, and increases in maximum level of CIB developed in all groups as a function of daily treatment. These effects persisted throughout the 63-day posttreatment period. It is concluded that, in within-S experimental designs, prolongation of CIB (which has been attributed to receptor supersensitivity) may reflect age-related factors, since heavier, older Ss showed prolonged CIB on initial injection. In contrast, decreased latency of CIB, as well as increased maximum levels of CIB, were identified as indices of response augmentation that did not differ initially as a function of age-related factors, as they developed similarly in all groups with chronic treatment. Changes observed during and following chronic treatment are discussed in terms of possible changes in biotransformation and/or altered dopamine receptor function.

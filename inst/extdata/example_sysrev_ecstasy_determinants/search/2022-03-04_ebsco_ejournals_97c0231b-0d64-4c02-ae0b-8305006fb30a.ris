AB  - Recreational ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) use has been                 increasingly associated with a number of psychiatric symptoms and psychological                 problems. However, previous studies assessing possible psychopathological effects                 have not identified whether users consider their ecstasy use                 ‘problematic’ or not. In addition, research has generally failed                 to address the potential role of premorbid psychiatric status. This study aimed to                 assess whether premorbid psychiatric history and/or patterns of ecstasy use would be                 associated with the degree of selfreported problems attributable to ecstasy.                 Problematic ecstasy users (n 53) who had reported problems attributable to their                 ecstasy use were compared with non-problematic ecstasy users (n 62), polydrug                 controls (n 62) and illegal drug-naive controls (n 111) on a recreational drug use                 questionnaire; a questionnaire, which ascertained personal and family psychiatric                 histories, and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Problematic ecstasy users                 exhibited significantly higher scores on a number of dimensions of the BSI compared                 to illegal drugnaive and/or polydrug controls. Problematic ecstasy users also                 exhibited significantly elevated scores on somatization, depression, anxiety and                 negative psychobiology compared to non-problematic ecstasy users. BSI scores for the                 non-problematic ecstasy users did not differ from polydrug or illegal drug-naive                 controls. Problematic ecstasy users reported significantly higher levels of ecstasy                 use, including lifetime consumption, average dosage and binge consumption compared                 to non-problematic ecstasy users. Additionally, a greater number of problematic                 ecstasy users reported personal and family psychiatric histories compared to                 controls and non-problematic ecstasy users. This study demonstrates two distinct                 ecstasy using groups: non-problematic ecstasy users who are not showing signs of                 psychopathology and problematic ecstasy users who are showing evidence of a range of                 symptoms. This data therefore partially supports the link between ecstasy dosage and                 negative psychological sequalae, but highlights the importance of the need to                 consider ecstasy-related attributions, pre-existing mental health status and vulnerability.

AB  - The recreational drug 'ecstasy'3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) exerts a potent action on central serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons. These neurons utilize neurotrophins for their survival and function. In order to explore MDMA effects on neurotrophins, we measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in 'ecstasy-addicted', 'ecstasy-addicted with signs of psychosis' and 'healthy' subjects. We found that BDNF serum levels were significantly increased in both groups of 'ecstasy-addicted' as compared with 'healthy subjects', supporting the hypothesis that BDNF is involved in MDMA action.

AB  - Rationale: Stimulant use, including cocaine, often occurs in a social context whose influence is important to understand to decrease intake and reduce associated harms. Although the importance of social influence in the context of drug addiction is known, there is a need for studies assessing its neurobiological substrate and for translational research.                     Objectives: Here, we explored the influence of peer presence and familiarity on cocaine intake and its neurobiological basis. Given the regulatory role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on cocaine intake and emotions, we investigated its role on such influence of social context on cocaine intake.                     Methods: We first compared cocaine consumption in various conditions (with no peer present or with peers with different characteristics: abstinent peer or drug-taking peer, familiar or not, cocaine-naive or not, dominant or subordinate) in rats (n= 90). Then, with a translational approach, we assessed the influence of the social context (alone, in the group, in a dyad with familiar or non-familiar peers) on drug intake in human drug users (n= 77).                     Results: The drug consumption was reduced when a peer was present, abstinent, or drug-taking as well, and further diminished when the peer was non-familiar. The presence of a non-familiar and drug-naive peer represents key conditions to diminish cocaine intake. The STN lesion by itself reduced cocaine intake to the level reached in presence of a non-familiar naive peer and affected social cognition, positioning the STN as one neurobiological substrate of social influence on drug intake. Then, the human study confirmed the beneficial effect of social presence, especially of non-familiar peers.                     Conclusion: Our results indirectly support the use of social interventions and harm reduction strategies and position  the STN as a key cerebral structure to mediate these effects.

AB  - Repeated cocaine use induces coordinated changes in gene expression that drive plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), an important component of the brain’s reward circuitry, and promote the development of maladaptive, addiction-like behaviors. Studies on the molecular basis of cocaine action identify transcription factors, a class of proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate transcription, as critical mediators of this cocaine-induced plasticity. Early methods to identify and study transcription factors involved in addiction pathophysiology primarily relied on quantifying the expression of candidate genes in bulk brain tissue after chronic cocaine treatment, as well as conventional overexpression and knockdown techniques. More recently, advances in next generation sequencing, bioinformatics, cell-type-specific targeting, and locus-specific neuroepigenomic editing offer a more powerful, unbiased toolbox to identify the most important transcription factors that drive drug-induced plasticity and to causally define their downstream molecular mechanisms. Here, we synthesize the literature on transcription factors mediating cocaine action in the NAc, discuss the advancements and remaining limitations of current experimental approaches, and emphasize recent work leveraging bioinformatic tools and neuroepigenomic editing to study transcription factors involved in cocaine addiction.

AB  - Abstract: Aim: To analyse drug consumption patterns and demographic and medical factors associated with health-related quality of life (HRQL) in a nonclinical sample of regular cocaine consumers. Methods: Face-to-face interviews with 687 young regular cocaine users (aged 18–30 years) in three Spanish cities: Barcelona, Madrid and Seville. HRQL was measured using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and degree of dependence through the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS). Bivariate analyses were conducted using nonparametric techniques, and a Tobit regression analysis was carried out to determine which variables best explained HRQL. Results: Most participants showed a good HRQL, but differences in HRQL were found for sociodemographic (gender), medical (days stayed in bed during the previous 12 months) and consumption-pattern related variables (length of drug use, intravenous drug use, crack use, SDS). In multivariate analyses cocaine dependence measured by SDS explained the greatest amount of HRQL variation. Although women declared worse HRQL (13.6 versus 9.7, P < 0.01), in the final model with interactions no gender differences were observed, except that HRQL for women worsened with the number of days they had stayed in bed in the previous 12 months. Conclusions: Even in early phases of dependence, deterioration in HRQL is observed, mainly related to drug-use history and patterns.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate factors associated with early discontinuation of low‐dose ketamine infusions due to adverse drug events (ADEs). A retrospective, matched case‐control study of surgical patients who received low‐dose ketamine infusions for postoperative pain over 6 years was conducted. Forty‐seven study patients, who required early discontinuation of their infusion due to ADEs, were included and matched 1:1 with 47 controls, who did not experience ADEs, for a total of 94 patients. The two groups were compared based on surgery type, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, administration of specific perioperative anxiolytic, anesthetic, and analgesic medications, and use of regional anesthesia. Of the study patients, 44.7% underwent spine procedures (vs. 34% of controls), 27.6% underwent abdominal procedures (vs. 8.5% of controls), 19.2% underwent orthopedic procedures (vs. 46.8% of controls), and 8.5% underwent thoracic procedures (vs. 6.4% of controls). There were no statistically significant differences in ASA classification, pre‐operative gabapentinoid and antidepressant use, average ketamine infusion dose, or postoperative use of peripheral nerve catheters, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, muscle relaxants, and nonbenzodiazepine sleep aides. Study patients had higher rates of intra‐operative volatile anesthetic use (78.7% vs. 57.7%, p= 0.03) and more postoperative opioid patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA) use (53.2% vs. 29.8%, p= 0.02) than controls. Control patients had higher rates of preoperative opioid use (76.7% vs. 53.2%, p= 0.02) and premedication with midazolam (89.4% vs. 70.2%, p= 0.02) than study patients. Patients who required discontinuation of their low‐dose ketamine infusion due to ADEs were more likely to be opioid naïve, received less pre‐operative benzodiazepines, and had greater postoperative opioid PCA requirements. Control patients, on the other hand, had higher rates of pre‐operative opioid use and experienced fewer ADEs despite greater total ketamine doses.

AB  - Although MDMA (ecstasy) is a relatively safe recreational drug and is currently considered for therapeutic use for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), recreational MDMA use occasionally elicits hyperthermia and hyponatremia, sometimes with a fatal outcome. Specific risk factors for both adverse effects are profuse sweating while vigorously dancing under unfavorable conditions such as high ambient temperatures and insufficient fluid suppletion which result in dehydration. Concomitant use of MDMA and alcohol is highly prevalent, but adds to the existing risk, because alcohol facilitates the emergence of MDMA-induced adverse events, like hyperthermia, dehydration, and hyponatremia. Because of potential health-related consequences of concomitant use of MDMA and alcohol, it is important to identify the mechanisms of the interactions between alcohol and MDMA. This review summarizes the main drivers of MDMA-induced hyperthermia, dehydration, and hyponatremia and the role of concomitant alcohol use. It is shown that alcohol use has a profound negative impact by its interaction with most of these drivers, including poikilothermia, exposure to high ambient temperatures, heavy exercise (vigorous dancing), vasoconstriction, dehydration, and delayed initiation of sweating and diuresis. It is concluded that recreational and clinical MDMA-users should refrain from concomitant drinking of alcoholic beverages to reduce the risk for adverse health incidents when using MDMA.

AB  - Cocaine use disorder is associated with alterations in immune function including altered expression of multiple peripheral cytokines in humans—several of which correlate with drug use. Individuals suffering from cocaine use disorder show altered immune system responses to drug-associated cues, highlighting the interaction between the brain and immune system as a critical factor in the development and expression of cocaine use disorder. We have previously demonstrated in animal models that cocaine use upregulates the expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)—a pleiotropic cytokine—in the serum and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). G-CSF signaling has been causally linked to behavioral responses to cocaine across multiple behavioral domains. The goal of this study was to define whether increases in G-CSF alter the pharmacodynamic effects of cocaine on the dopamine system and whether this occurs via direct mechanisms within local NAc microcircuits. We find that systemic G-CSF injection increases cocaine effects on dopamine terminals. The enhanced dopamine levels in the presence of cocaine occur through a release-based mechanism, rather than through effects on the dopamine transporter—as uptake rates were unchanged following G-CSF treatment. Critically, this effect could be recapitulated by acute bath application of G-CSF to dopamine terminals, an effect that was occluded by prior G-CSF treatment, suggesting a similar mechanistic basis for direct and systemic exposures. This work highlights the critical interaction between the immune system and psychostimulant effects that can alter drug responses and may play a role in vulnerability to cocaine use disorder.

AB  - Evidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants’ Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2–7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p= 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p= 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p= 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p= 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p= 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

AB  - Abstract:On January 2, 2020, Princeton University opened to the public 1,131 previously unseen letters from T. S. Eliot to Emily Hale, whom he had known when he was a student at Harvard. In this correspondence, which stretches from 1930 to 1956, Eliot removes his mask and freely discusses his feelings about life, love, poetry, politics, and religion. This paper discusses a major spiritual pattern found in the letters.

AB  - Stress, through corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), influences all aspects of cocaine addiction. Earlier studies suggest that individual differences in responsivity to stress affect susceptibility to develop addiction. We have previously found that CRF over-expression alters individual differences in behavioural responses to novelty stress in mice. Therefore, we hypothesised that post-natal, long-term over-expression of brain CRF may alter the rewarding effects of cocaine in a manner that is sensitive to individual differences. In this study we specifically investigated cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in transgenic mice over-expressing CRF (CRF-OE) and in wild-type (WT) littermates after determining their individual locomotor and emotional responsivity to inescapable novelty. CRF-OE mice showed decreased overall locomotor activity and increased anxiety-like behaviour in response to novelty compared to WT mice. Low behavioural reactivity to novelty (LR) was associated with heightened anxiety-like behaviour in CRF-OE, but not in WT, mice. WT and CRF-OE mice developed CPP equally to both low (5mg/kg) and high (20mg/kg) doses of cocaine. However, LR CRF-OE mice expressed significantly stronger cocaine CPP than transgenic mice with high locomotor response to novelty (HR). In WT mice, on the other hand, stronger CPP induced by 20mg/kg of cocaine was found in the HR animals. Furthermore, there was a strong negative correlation between locomotor reactivity to novelty and CPP in CRF-OE, but not in WT, mice. Collectively, these results suggest that long-term, post-natal CRF over-expression increases the rewarding effects of cocaine in individuals with high emotional response to stress.

AB  - ABSTRACTBackgroundAnecdotal evidence suggests a substantial proportion of individuals with cocaine use disorder do not report craving during inpatient detoxification.ObjectiveTo examine prevalence and clinical correlates of consistent absence of cocaine craving among inpatients during detoxification. We hypothesized that craving absence would be associated with less severity of cocaine use, depression, and anxiety. Alternative explanations were also explored.MethodsCraving absence (i.e., non-cravers) was defined as a daily score of zero across two separate craving visual analogue scales in each of the inpatient days. Participants scoring ≥1 on ≥1 day were considered cravers. Severity of cocaine use disorder as well as in-treatment depression and anxiety were assessed. Alternative contributors included presence of cocaine and other substances in urine at admission, in-treatment prescription of psychotropic medications, treatment motivation, executive function, interoception, and social desirability.ResultsEighty-seven participants (78.2% males) met criteria as either non-cravers (n= 29; 33.3%) or cravers (n= 58; 66.7%). Mean length of admission in non-cravers and cravers was, respectively, 10.83 and 13.16 days. Binary logistic regression model showed that non-cravers scored significantly lower than cravers on cocaine use during last month before treatment (OR, 95% CI; 0.902, 0.839–0.970), in-treatment depression (OR, 95% CI; 0.794, 0.659–0.956), and in-treatment prescribing of antipsychotics (OR, 95% CI; 0.109, 0.014–0.823). Model prediction accuracy was 88.9%.ConclusionsOne in three patients undergoing inpatient detoxification experienced absence of craving, linked to less pretreatment cocaine use, better mood, and decreased administration of antipsychotics. Findings may inform pretreatment strategies and improve treatment cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Objectives: This study estimated the prevalence, genotype distribution, and the factors associated with oral human papillomavirus (HPV) in people who use crack-cocaine (PWUCC) in a remote Brazilian region.                     Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study used community-based snowball sampling methods for participant recruitment. Socio-demographic, economic, drug use, and health-related information was collected from 278 PWUCC in the cities of Bragança and Capanema in northern Brazil. HPV diagnosis and genotyping were performed by a real-time polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression identified the factors independently associated with oral HPV.                     Results: In total, 111 (39.9%) PWUCC had HPV DNA. Several genotypes were identified, some of them with high oncogenic potential. Crack-cocaine use =40 months, unprotected sex, more than 10 sexual partners in the last 12 months, oral sex, exchange of sex for money or illicit drugs, oral mucosa lesions, not having access to public health services, and the absence of vaccination against HPV was all associated with HPV DNA.                     Conclusions: This study identified important epidemiological characteristics of oral HPV infection among PWUCC—a highly marginalized risk population—underlining the high prevalence of oral HPV with oncogenic potential and the urgent need for control and prevention measures, especially vaccination against this virus.                     Clinical relevance: It is necessary to understand the prevalence and risk factors of oral HPV in risk populations as people who use crack-cocaine.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe aim of this study was to study the influence factors of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH3in flue gas and to clarify the mechanism of SCR over activated coke (AC). An AC in various simulated flue gases for reduction of NO was examined in a fixed-bed reactor. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to performhigh-resolution scanning of surface N element. The results indicate that the presence of O2in flue gas facilitates the NO reduction in SCR. Higher polarity of H2O molecule may inhibit NH3or NO adsorption on the surface of ACs, so that NO reduction has been restrained. A lowest NO conversion was tested at 250°C in the temperature range of 100–350°C, meaning that may presence of different SCR mechanism at low or high temperature. Adsorption of NH3below 250°C is dominated by physical adsorption and adsorption of NH3higher than 250°C is dominatedby the chemical reaction between NH3and AC base on the determination of XPS and adsorption capacities of NH3. There was a good correlation between adsorption capacity of NH3and NO conversion, which indicated that NH3adsorption is a key step in SCR regardless of whether NH3was physically or chemically adsorbed on the AC.

AB  - Susac syndrome (SS) is a central nervous system vasculitis characterized by the clinical triad of encephalopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and visual disturbance caused by branch retinal artery occlusion. It is considered as an inflammatory disorder, and an autoimmune etiology is suggested. A 29-year-old man with a history of recent cocaine abuse developed the clinical features of SS. Toxicological analysis including hair testing revealed that cocaine had been adulterated with levamisole. After an initial clinical improvement following corticosteroid therapy, the introduction of mycophenolate mofetil was justified a few weeks later by the progression (or relapse) of the retinal injury, followed by complete recovery. The presence of levamisole has been documented in patients with multifocal inflammatory leukoencephalopathy (MIL). Further investigations are needed to determine if levamisole as an adulterant of cocaine could also play a role in the development of rapidly progressive leukoencephalopathy in young men, with Susac or Susac-like syndromes as possible variants of MIL.

AB  - AbstractObjectivesSynaptic plasticity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling are proposed to play key roles in antidepressant drug action. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and putative antidepressant, may increase synaptic plasticity in prefrontal cortex through higher expression of BDNF. Furthermore, ketamine was shown to change resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC).MethodsIn a randomised, placebo-controlled study, we investigated acutely (100 min) and at 24 h following subanesthetic ketamine infusion which dmPFC seeded RSFC changes are most strongly associated with plasma BDNF level changes in 53 healthy participants (21 females, age: 24.4 ± 2.9 years) using 7 T-fMRI.ResultsWe observed higher relative levels of BDNF 2 h and 24 h after ketamine compared to placebo. Whole-brain regression revealed that the change in BDNF after 24 h was associated with RSFC decreases from dmPFC to posterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial PFC at 24 h and exploratively also at the 100 min measurement point. Follow-up analyses revealed that RSFC reductions following ketamine were restricted to subjects showing increased BDNF levels at 24 h.ConclusionsOur findings indicate BDNF level dynamics following ketamine are related to acute and 24 h RSFC changes. Particularly when BDNF increases are observed after ketamine infusion, a disconnection from dmPFC after 24 h is seen and may reflect synaptic plasticity effects.

AB  - The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a critical brain region for cocaine-memory reconsolidation. Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 (CRFR1) is densely expressed in the BLA, and CRFR1 stimulation can activate intra-cellular signaling cascades that mediate memory reconsolidation. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that BLA CRFR1 stimulation is necessary and sufficient for cocaine-memory reconsolidation. Using an instrumental model of drug relapse, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats received cocaine self-administration training in a distinct environmental context over 10 days followed by extinction training in a different context over 7 days. Next, rats were re-exposed to the cocaine-paired context for 15 min to initiate cocaine-memory retrieval and destabilization. Immediately or 6 h after this session, the rats received bilateral vehicle, antalarmin (CRFR1 antagonist; 500 ng/hemisphere), or corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF; 0.2, 30 or 500 ng/hemisphere) infusions into the BLA. Resulting changes in drug context-induced cocaine seeking (index of context-cocaine memory strength) were assessed three days later. Female rats self-administered more cocaine infusions and exhibited more extinction responding than males. Intra-BLA antalarmin treatment immediately after memory retrieval (i.e., when cocaine memories were labile), but not 6 h later (i.e., after memory reconsolidation), attenuated drug context-induced cocaine seeking at test independent of sex, relative to vehicle. Conversely, intra-BLA CRF treatment increased this behavior selectively in females, in a U-shaped dose-dependent fashion. In control experiments, a high (behaviorally ineffective) dose of CRF treatment did not reduce BLA CRFR1 cell-surface expression in females. Thus, BLA CRFR1 signaling is necessary and sufficient, in a sex-dependent manner, for regulating cocaine-memory strength.

AB  - Background: Crack-cocaine dependence is a serious public health issue, related to several psychiatric and psychosocial problems. Crack-cocaine users are usually embedded in a context of great social vulnerability, often associated with violence, poverty, family conflict and easy and early access to alcohol, tobacco and other drugs.                     Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled a consecutive sample of 577 patients admitted to 20 therapeutic communities located in Southern Brazil, between September 2012 and September 2013. A structured interview assessed life-time exposure to risk and protective factors for drug use, such as parental monitoring in childhood, deviant behaviors and peer pressure.                     Results: Presence of family conflict (p= 0.002), maltreatment (p= 0.016), and deviant behavior prior to age 15 in a bivariate analysis predicted an earlier age of crack-cocaine initiation, whereas adolescents experiencing parental monitoring during adolescence started use later (p&lt; 0.001). In the multivariate model, perceptions related to ease of access of illicit drugs (marijuana: p= 0.028, 95% CI = − 3.81, − 0.22; crack-cocaine: p&lt; 0.001, 95% CI = − 7.40, − 4.90), and deviant behavior (threatening someone with a gun: p= 0.028, 95% CI = − 2.57, − 0.14) remained independent predictors of early age of crack-cocaine initiation.                     Conclusions: Early onset of crack-cocaine use seems to be associated with exposure to family conflict, easy access to drugs and deviant behavior. Treatment and preventive programs should take these factors into account when designing and implementing community interventions.

AB  - Global warming remains one of the greatest challenges. One of the most prominent solutions is to close the carbon cycle by utilizing the greenhouse gas: CO2,and CH4, as a feedstock via the dry reforming of methane (DRM). This work provided an insight into how the NiCo bimetallic catalyst can perform with high stability against coking during DRM compared to the Ni and Co monometallic catalysts, in which the experimental and computational techniques based on density functional theory were performed. It was found that the high stability against coking found on the NiCo surface can be summarized into two key factors: (1) the role of Co weakening the bond between a Ni active site and coke (2) significantly high surface coke diffusion rate on NiCo. Moreover, the calculation of the surface fraction weighted rate of coke diffusion which modeled the real NiCo particle into four regions: Ni-dominant, Co-dominant, NiCo-dominant, and the mixed region consisting a comparable amount of the former there regions, have shown that the synthesis of a NiCo particle should be dominated with NiCo region while keeping the Ni-dominant, and Co-dominant regions to be as low as possible to facilitate coke diffusion and removal. Thus, to effectively utilize the coke-resistant property of NiCo catalyst for DRM, one should together combine its high coke diffusion rate with coke removal mechanisms such as oxidation or hydrogenation, especially at the final diffusion site, to ensure that there will not be enough coke at the final site that will cause back-diffusion.

AB  - AbstractObjectiveRhabdomyolysis is associated with methamphetamine, amphetamine, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MA) use. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency, severity, and risk factors of rhabdomyolysis associated with MA use. Methods:We reviewed patients with an MA-positive toxicology screen with and without diagnosed rhabdomyolysis based on initial creatine kinase (CK) concentration over a period of 6 years. Demographics, vital signs, disposition, diagnoses, and laboratory results were recorded. Results:There were 7,319 patients with an MA-positive toxicology screen, of whom 957 (13%) were screened for rhabdomyolysis and included in the study. The majority were male, White, and middle-aged and smoked tobacco. Psychiatric (34%), neurological (15%), and trauma (13%) were the most common discharge diagnostic groups. The majority (55%) were admitted, and 8% were discharged to an inpatient psychiatric facility. Concomitant substance use included ethanol (10%) and cocaine (8%), and 190 (20%) had rhabdomyolysis with median (interquartile range) CK of 2,610 (1,530–6,212) U/L and range 1,020 to 98,172 U/L. There was significant difference in renal function between the rhabdomyolysis and non-rhabdomyolysis patients. Other differences included gender and troponin I concentration. A higher proportion of patients screening positive for both MA and cocaine use experienced rhabdomyolysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed elevated troponin I, blood urea nitrogen, and/or creatinine concentration and male gender to be significant factors associated with rhabdomyolysis. Conclusions:The frequency of rhabdomyolysis in patients screening positive for MA was 20%. Factors associated with rhabdomyolysis in MA-positive patients included elevated troponin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine concentration, and male gender. Clinicians caring for patients who screen positive for MA should also consider concomitant rhabdomyolysis, especially if renal/cardiac laboratory tests are abnormal and even if there is no history of injury, agitation, or physical restraint.

AB  - Ketamine (KET), an anesthetic, analgesic, and a sedative N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist agent, exposure during neonatal period may lead to learning impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive decline in the later years of life. In recent studies, it has been reported that sedative-acting α2 agonist dexmedetomidine (DEX), which is commonly used in clinical practice with KET, has neuroprotective effects and prevents the undesirable effects of anesthesia. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these actions, we investigated the interaction between NMDA receptors α2adrenoceptor and adulthood behaviors in neonatally KET and/or DEX administrated mice. Balb/c male mice were administrated with saline, KET (75 mg/kg), DEX (10 µg/kg), or KET + DEX (75 mg/kg + 10 µg/kg) on postnatal day 7. During adulthood (8–10 weeks old) mice were subjected to elevated plus maze, open field, and Morris water maze tests. After behavioral tests, hippocampus samples were extracted for mRNA expression studies of NMDAR subunits (GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B) and α2adrenoceptor subunits (α2A, α2B, and α2C) by real-time PCR. Ketamine increased horizontal and vertical locomotor activity (p< 0.01) and impaired spatial learning-memory (p< 0.05). DEX increased anxiety-like behavior (p< 0.01), but did not affect spatial learning-memory and locomotor activity. KET + DEX impaired spatial learning-memory (p< 0.01), increased horizontal locomotor activity (p< 0.01), and anxiety-like behavior (p< 0.05). Our study implies that DEX cannot prevent the adverse effects of KET, on spatial learning-memory, and locomotor activity. In addition to this, it can be thought that during brain development, there is an interaction between NMDAR and α2adrenoceptor systems.

AB  - Studies have linked cocaine dependence to suicidality. According to the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, suicidal behavior becomes likely with the simultaneous presence of perceived burdensomeness (PB), lack of (or thwarted) belongingness (TB), and acquired fearlessness about death (FAD). Here, we examined personality and other variables, including depression, self‐esteem, childhood abuse, and substance use, as predictors of these risk factors in cocaine‐dependent individuals (CDs). Seventy CDs and 70 healthy controls (HCs) participated. We examined group differences in a group‐by‐sex analysis of variance and identified predictors of PB, TB, and FAD in stepwise regressions. CDs exhibited elevated PB and TB but not FAD, compared to HCs. CDs also exhibited elevated harm avoidance, novelty seeking, depression, and lower self‐esteem and reward dependence. Females reported elevated sexual abuse, harm avoidance, reward dependence, depression, but lower FAD, relative to males, among CDs and HCs. Among CDs, PB was predicted by lower self‐esteem and greater emotional abuse; TB was predicted by lower self‐esteem and reward dependence, as well as greater emotional and sexual abuse; and FAD was predicted by lower harm avoidance and greater physical abuse. Interventions targeting suicidality in cocaine dependence should take into consideration self‐esteem, personality traits, and childhood abuse.

AB  - AbstractBackground:The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with concurrent illicit drug use of opiates and crack/cocaine use among individuals receiving of opioid medication-assisted treatment (MAT) in one English rural/urban County Council area.Methods:776 opiate users in treatment were assessed using the Addiction Dimensions for Assessment and Personalised Treatment (ADAPT) assessment tool. The tool encompasses three domains and 14 subdomains covering addiction severity, recovery strengths and coexisting health and social needs. Data were opportunistically matched to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS) and the Treatment Outcome Profile (TOP). Two backward stepwise logistic regression models were run to discern the nature of concurrent illicit drug use.Results:Addiction severity (Odds Ratio [OR] 12.55, Confidence interval [CI] 6.49–24.27), low recovery strengths (OR 2.30, CI 1.30–4.07) and no ‘urge/control’ (OR 27.45, 13.18–57.16) were strongly associated with concurrent use. Individuals with moderate psychological needs were more likely to be abstinent (OR 2.97, CI 1.67–5.29) compared to those with no need. Abstaining from injecting (OR 2.38, CI 1.15–4.93), alcohol consumption (OR 1.55, CI 1.05–2.30), increasing age (OR 1.03, CI 1.01-1.06) and increased quality-of-life (OR 1.05, CI 1.00–1.10) were associated with abstinence from concurrent use.Conclusion:Practitioner assessments with self-report data offer unique perspectives on service users’ holistic needs. Interventions addressing concurrent use during MAT should consider managing urges and control of illicit Class A use, injecting and alcohol consumption within a stepped-care approach. Packages for developing recovery strengths supporting psychological need and enhancing quality-of-life is recommended.

AB  - ABSTRACTBackground: We present three women with gamm a- Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) dependence who lose control over their GHB consumption during the premenstrual period. During the late luteal phase, they relapsed into GHB use, but returned to abstinence at the beginning of the menstrual cycle.Methods: During inpatient detox they did not relapsed to GHB but they had high craving during each cycle We have measured these in two cycles. The severity of premenstrual complaints appears to be associated with GHB craving.Results: These cases illustrate that substance usemay be related to the symptoms of premenstrual disorders.Conclusion: Therefore, addiction medicine specialists, family physicians and gynecologists should be aware of this possible relationship. Unfortunately, at present there are no guidelines for the treatment of this co-occurring disorder, however we provide some suggestions regarding how to reduce the risk of relapse in the late luteal phase.

AB  - Illicit use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) may cause a mild or severe form of the serotonin syndrome. The syndrome intensity is not just influenced by drug doses but also by environmental factors.                   Warm environmental temperatures and physical activity are features of raves. The purpose of this study was to assess how these two factors can potentially intensify the syndrome.                   Rats were administered MDMA at doses of 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg and examined in the absence or presence of warm temperature and physical activity. The syndrome intensity was estimated by visual scoring for behavioral syndrome and also instrumentally measuring changes in symptoms of the syndrome.                   Our results showed that MDMA at 3 mg/kg, but not 0.3 or 1 mg/kg, caused a mild serotonin syndrome in rats. Each environmental factor alone moderately intensified the syndrome. When the two factors were combined, the intensification became more severe than each factor alone highlighting a synergistic effect. This intensification was blocked by the 5-HT2Areceptor antagonist M100907, competitive N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist CGS19755, autonomic ganglionic blocker hexamethonium, and the benzodiazepine-GABAAreceptor agonist midazolam but not by the 5-HT1Areceptor antagonist WAY100635 or nicotinic receptor antagonist methyllycaconitine.                   Our data suggest that, in the absence of environmental factors, the MDMA-induced syndrome is mainly mediated through the serotonergic transmission (5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)-dependent mechanism) and therefore is relatively mild. Warm temperature and physical activity facilitate serotonergic and other neural systems such as glutamatergic and autonomic transmissions, resulting in intensification of the syndrome (non-5HT mechanisms).

AB  - Abstract: The carbon dissolving reaction is the main factor for the deterioration of coke in the blast furnace. Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of coke deterioration on the permeability of blast furnace, the Coke Pulverization Rate (CPR) which represented the degree of Matrix carbon loss after carbon dissolution was put forward in this paper. The results showed that the CPR increases with the increase of volatile of coal blending, ash content of coke, M<sub>10</sub>and coke reactivity index (CRI), while decreases with the rising of M<sub>40</sub>and coke strength after reactivity (CSR). Analysis of the production data of 5BF blast furnace of Meishan Steel showed that under the conditions of coke ash (A<sub>d</sub>) &lt; 12.2%, M<sub>10</sub>&lt; 6.5%, M<sub>40</sub>> 87%, CRI &lt; 26% and CSR > 66%, the CPR would be less than 23%, which is conductive to ensure stable permeability large blast furnace.

AB  - To investigate the mechanism of bladder nerve hyperplasia and fibrosis in the patients with ketamine‐associated cystitis (KC). Sixteen patients with severe KC, six patients with mild KC, and five patients with localized invasive bladder cancer served as control patients. Bladder mucosa specimens were taken during the operations, and the specimens were stained for nerve growth factor (NGF) and S‐100 to evaluated nerve hyperplasia. The quantitative Western blot analysis was performed for NGF, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), growth‐associated protein 43 (GAP‐43), tropomyosin receptor kinase A and B (TrkA and TrkB), transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β), phosphorylated extracellular signal‐regulated kinases (p‐ERK), protein kinase B (p‐Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (p‐GSK‐3β). The results demonstrated diffuse NGF expression in KC bladder epithelium, lamina propria, and muscle. The GAP‐43, NGF, BDNF, TrkA, TGF‐β, p‐ERK, P‐AKT, and p‐GSK‐3β expression in the bladder mucosa specimens of patients with severe KC was significantly higher than in patients with mild KC and control patients. Expression of neurotrophins was significantly correlated with bladder capacity and pain. NGF and BDNF expression were significantly higher in the KC bladder specimens with strongly positive S‐100 staining. TGF‐β expression in the bladder specimens was significantly correlated with neurotrophins, p‐ERK, P‐AKT, and p‐GSK‐3β levels. Our findings indicate upregulation of neurotrophins, TGF‐β, and activation of the cell proliferation kinases plays an important role in nerve hyperplasia and fibrosis mechanisms in severe KC bladders. The neurotrophins and TGF‐β interact as cause and effect, leading to bladder hypersensitivity and fibrosis in severe KC.

AB  - Addiction and eating disorders involve brain reward circuits. Binge eating predisposes to addictive behavior, while the cessation of exposure to drugs of abuse leads to reward activities, including intake of tasty foods. Cocaine use is associated with a decrease in food intake, with reversal after drug use is discontinued. Exciting new findings show that receptors for the ‘hunger’ hormone, ghrelin, directly interact with the sigma-1 receptor (σ1R), which is a target of cocaine. σ1Rs are key players in regulating dopaminergic neurotransmission and ghrelin-mediated actions. This review focuses on the σ1receptor as a general neuroendocrine regulator by directly interacting with neuronal G-protein-coupled receptors. This review also covers the early mechanisms by which cocaine binding to σ1blocks the food-seeking behavior triggered by ghrelin. Those findings appear as fundamental to understand common mechanisms in drug addiction and eating disorders.

AB  - Addiction to psychostimulants is a major public health crisis that leads to significant morbidity and mortality, for which there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies. Female subjects have increased propensity to develop pathological substance use disorders after initial use, suggesting the possibility of different pathophysiological mechanisms between males and females. Recently, we identified the neuroactive cytokine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) as a key mediator of neuronal and behavioral plasticity in response to cocaine in male mice. Here, we found that G-CSF potentiated the rewarding effects of cocaine in female mice as well; however, the dopaminergic mechanism linked to these effects was highly dependent on the ovarian hormone cycle. G-CSF treatment enhanced the ability of cocaine to inhibit dopamine clearance; however, this effect was observed specifically during pro/estrus, when circulating ovarian hormone levels were high. These findings demonstrate important sex differences in the synaptic effects of this translationally relevant neuroimmune modulator.

AB  - Nicotine and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcripts (CART) have several overlapping functions, such as the regulation of reward, feeding behavior, stress response, and anxiety. Previous studies showed that nicotine regulates CART expression in various brain regions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation are not known. This study investigated the regulatory effect of nicotine on promoter activity of the CART gene in PC12 cells, which were differentiated into a neuronal phenotype by nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment. Two vectors containing reporter genes (Gaussia luciferase or mCherry) and the 1,140-bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of the mouse CART gene are used to analyze the CART promoter activity. Transient transfection of PC12 cells with either vector displayed strong promoter activity in both undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells. CART promoter activity in the PC12 cell line is increased by forskolin or NGF treatment. In differentiated PC12 cells, exposure to 50 nM nicotine for 6 h increased CART promoter activity. However, treatment with higher nicotine doses for 6 h and treatment with all nicotine doses for 24 h showed no effect. A nicotine concentration of 50 nM is comparable to brain nicotine levels experienced by chronic smokers over long periods of time. Taken together, these data indicate that nicotine may exert some of its actions through the regulation of CART transcription in the brain.

AB  - AbstractWhile a disproportionately large percentage of sexual minorities engage in illicit drug use, little research has specifically examined factors related to cocaine use among bisexual men and women. The present study sought to identify the potential association between affective/emotive states and previous substance use and lifetime cocaine use among a national sample of bisexual men and women. A secondary analysis of the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health was conducted among 1,989 adults aged older than 18 years in the United States who identified as bisexual. One in five (20.5%) reported lifetime cocaine use. Significant factors included age, previous use of illicit substances, and feeling low/tired nearly every day. Feeling worthless was associated with a lower likelihood of lifetime cocaine use. Recommendations (e.g., focus groups, behavioral maintenance programs) for health professionals aimed at reducing substance abuse rates among sexual minority individuals are highlighted.

AB  - Ketamine is widely used in pediatric anesthesia, perioperative sedation, and analgesia. Knowledge of anesthesia neurotoxicity in humans is currently limited by the difficulty of obtaining neurons and performing developmental toxicity studies in fetal and pediatric populations. However, mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) derived from embryos at the preimplantation stage demonstrate an unlimited ability to self-renew and generate different cell types and are a valuable tool for clinical research. Thus, in this study, a model was employed to investigate the mechanism by which ketamine (200 nM) influences the neuronal differentiation of mESCs. Mouse ESCs were treated with an anesthetic dose of ketamine, and neuronal differentiation was significantly inhibited on day 5. Downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by shRNA was found to have the same inhibitory effect. Furthermore, a rescue experiment indicated that BDNF overexpression markedly restored the neuronal differentiation inhibited by ketamine in the ketamine/BDNF group on day 5. Taken together, these data suggested that ketamine inhibited the neuronal differentiation of mESCs, possibly by interfering with BDNF. The results of the current study may provide novel ideas for preventing ketamine toxicity in the developing fetus.

AB  - Brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates a variety of physiological processes, and several studies have explored the role of BDNF in addiction‐related brain regions like the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). We sought to understand the rapid effects of endogenous BDNF on cocaine seeking. Rats were trained to self‐administer cocaine and extinguished. We then microinjected two inhibitors of BDNF stimulation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), the non‐competitive receptor antagonist ANA‐12 and TrkB/Fc, a fusion protein that binds BDNF and prevents TrkB stimulation. Blocking TrkB or inactivating BDNF in NAcore potentiated active lever pressing, showing that endogenous BDNF tone was present and supplying inhibitory tone on cue‐induced reinstatement. To determine if exogenous BDNF also negatively regulated reinstatement, BDNF was microinjected into NAcore 15 minutes before cue‐induced reinstatement. BDNF decreased cocaine seeking through TrkB receptor binding, but had no effect on inactive lever pressing, spontaneous or cocaine‐induced locomotion, or on reinstated sucrose seeking. BDNF‐infusion potentiated within trial extinction when microinjected in the NAcore during cue‐ and context + cue induced reinstatement, and the inhibition of lever pressing lasted at least 3 days post injection. Although decreased reinstatement endured for 3 days when BDNF was administered prior to a reinstatement session, when microinjected before an extinction session or in the home cage, BDNF did not alter subsequent cued‐reinstatement. Together, these data show that endogenous BDNF acts on TrKB to provide inhibitory tone on reinstated cocaine seeking, and this effect was recapitulated by exogenous BDNF. We investigated the effect of endogenous brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secretion on cocaine seeking in the NAcore and discovered that BDNF‐induced tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling during cued‐reinstatement promoted within session extinction and decreased cocaine seeking. We were able to pharmacologically recreate the inhibition of cocaine seeking by acutely microinfusing BDNF in the NAcore before cue‐induced reinstatement. This effect was specific to cocaine seeking and did not alter inactive lever pressing, spontaneous or cocaine‐induced locomotion, or sucrose seeking.

AB  - Inhibitors of DNA methylation and orexin type-1 receptor antagonists modulate the neurobiological effects driving drugs of abuse and natural reinforcers by activating common brain structures of the mesolimbic reward system. In this study, we applied a self-administration paradigm to assess the involvement of factors regulating DNA methylation processes and satiety or appetite signals. These factors include Dnmts and Tets, miR-212/132, orexins, and orx-R1 genes.The study focused on dopamine projection areas such as the prefrontal cortex (PFCx) and caudate putamen (CPu) and in the hypothalamus (HP) that is interconnected with the reward system. Striking changes were observed in response to both reinforcers, but differed depending on contingent and non-contingent delivery. Expression also differed in the PFCx and the CPu. Cocaine and food induced opposite effects on Dnmt3aexpression in both brain structures, whereas they repressed both miRs to a different extent, without affecting their primary transcript in the CPu. Unexpectedly, orexin mRNAs were found in the CPu, suggesting a transport from their transcription site in the HP. The orexin receptor1gene was found to be induced by cocaine in the PFCx, consistent with a regulation by DNA methylation. Global levels of 5-methylcytosines in the PFCx were not significantly altered by cocaine, suggesting that it is rather their distribution that contributes to long-lasting behaviors. Together, our data demonstrate that DNA methylation regulating factors are differentially altered by cocaine and food. At the molecular level, they support the idea that neural circuits activated by both reinforcers do not completely overlap.

AB  - Since reproductive toxicity is associated with oxidative stress, nuclear factor κB (NFκB), a redox-sensitive transcription factor, may be involved in the reproductive dysfunction induced by the abusive drug, such as cocaine. In the present study, we investigated whether NFκB mediates cocaine-induced reproductive dysfunction in male mice, and whether glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1, a well-known enzymatic antioxidant, modulates NFκB activity to affect this reproductive dysfunction. Cocaine treatment significantly increased nuclear translocation of NFκB and its DNA binding activity in the testis of mice. Treatment with cocaine resulted in a significant increase in sperm abnormality, and in significant decreases in the sperm viability and sperm level. Furthermore, cocaine significantly reduced hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing-hormone expression and plasma testosterone level. These alterations were more pronounced in the GPx-1 knockout (GPx-1 KO) than wild type (WT) mice, and they were less pronounced in GPx-1 overexpressing transgenic (GPx-1 TG) than in non-transgenic (non-TG) mice. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NFκB inhibitor, was more effective in attenuating cocaine-induced reproductive toxicity in GPx-1 KO than in WT mice. Although PDTC treatment was also significantly protective against the reproductive toxicity in non-TG mice, PDTC did not show additional positive effects against the protective potential mediated by GPx-1 overexpression in mice. Therefore, our results suggest that GPx-1 gene is a protective factor in response to reproductive dysfunction induced by cocaine in male mice, and that NFκB is a critical mediator of protective activity of GPx-1 gene in our experimental conditions.

AB  - ABSTRACTIntroduction: MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, is a synthetic phenethylamine derivative with structural and pharmacological similarities to both amphetamines and mescaline. MDMA produces characteristic amphetamine-like actions (euphoria, well-being), increases empathy, and induces pro-social effects that seem to motivate its recreational consumption and provide a basis for its potential therapeutic use.Areas covered: The aim of this review is to present the main interindividual determinants in MDMA pharmacodynamics. The principal sources of pharmacodynamic variability are reviewed, with special emphasis on sex-gender, race-ethnicity, genetic differences, interactions, and MDMA acute toxicity, as well as possible therapeutic use.Expert opinion: Acute MDMA effects are more pronounced in women than they are in men. Very limited data on the relationship between race-ethnicity and MDMA effects are available. MDMA metabolism includes some polymorphic enzymes that can slightly modify plasma concentrations and effects. Although a considerable number of studies exist about the acute effects of MDMA, the small number of subjects in each trial limits evaluation of the different interindividual factors and does not permit a clear conclusion about their influence. These issues should be considered when studying possible MDMA therapeutic use.

AB  - Species of Theileria, Babesia, and Anaplasmaare Tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) that are prevalent throughout the world, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions. Associated diseases of Theileriosis, Babesiosis, and Anaplasmosis, respectively, represents a major threat to livestock production in many countries. TBPs have a high prevalence in different geographical locations in Egypt. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) and Lumpy skin disease (LSD) are considered endemic bovine viral diseases in Egypt. Our clinical observations during the epidemics of LSD and FMD viruses showed higher prevalence rates for the TBPs. To investigate this correlation, a total of 670 samples from cattle and buffalo were collected during the summers of 2017 and 2018 distributed throughout ranches and smallholders in two geographical locations in Egypt. Two farms with a recent clinical outbreak of LSD with a total of 270 animals, while the other location included three farms with a recent FMD outbreak with a combined 400 cattle. Examined animals were classified mainly according to age, gender, species, breed (native versus crossbred), and the presence of ticks. Whole blood samples were collected for TBPs and viral (LSD and FMD) examinations, while tissue specimens were collected for detection of FMD and LSD viruses by real-time PCR.

AB  - Coking is a substantial source of carbonaceous aerosols in China, but the emission characteristics and pollution levels of coking-produced organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) remain unknown, causing considerable uncertainty in emission estimates. In this study, the emission factors of OC (EFOC) and EC (EFEC) of typical coking plants in Shanxi, China, were measured. The measured EFECand EFOCfrom fugitive emissions (7.43 and 9.54 g/t) were significantly higher than those from flue gas (1.67 and 3.71 g/t). The technological conditions of coke production affect the emissions of OC and EC. For example, the total emissions from coke plants that use 3.2-m-high coke ovens were greater than those from plants that use 4.3- and 6-m-high ovens. The EFOCand EFECfor plants conducting stamp charging were considerably higher than those for plants using top charging. The stable carbon isotopes of total carbon (δ13CTC), OC (δ13COC), and EC (δ13CEC) for fly ash during coking were −23.74‰ to −24.17‰, −23.32‰ to −23.87‰, and −23.84‰ to −24.14‰, respectively, and no clear isotopic fractionation was found during coke production. Different EC/OC ratios from different emission pathways and the carbon isotope signature of coke production should be considered when investigating the sources of carbonaceous aerosols. The total estimated EC and OC emissions from coke production in China were 3.93 and 5.72 Gg in 2017, and Shanxi, Hebei, and Shaanxi made the largest contributions.

AB  - This paper explores the recent resurgence in use of ecstasy/MDMA in Europe and highlights keys areas of continuity and divergence between the ecstasy market of the 1990s and the current MDMA market. Based on a scoping study involving a targeted multi-source data collection exercise on MDMA, it highlights nine areas that have undergone some level of change, linked with both supply and demand for the drug. Factors discussed include: innovation in production techniques; changes in precursor chemical availability; the role of online markets; competition with other stimulants and new psychoactive substances; the increased availability of high-strength MDMA; and the shift from subcultural towards more mainstream use of the drug. The paper proposes that the MDMA on Europe’s contemporary market is in some respects a third generation product with a different consumer profile, with implications that responses developed at the time of the drug’s earlier iteration, may be in need of a review and revamp.

AB  - Sedation is often required for young children during transthoracic echocardiography. Dexmedetomidine and ketamine are two sedatives that are commonly used in children for procedural sedation, but they have some disadvantages when they are used alone. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the effects and safety of intranasal sedation with a combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine during transthoracic echocardiography in young children and to analyze risk factors for sedation failure. After IRBapproval, we retrospectively evaluated data on patients who underwent echocardiography between May 2016 and August 2017 utilizing a combination of dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg and ketamine 1 mg/kg. We collected information including heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation, sedation onset time, exam time, recovery time, and adverse reactions. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the risk factors for sedation failure. Sedation was successful in 2212 patients (96%) and took effect in 15.7 (IQR: 10‐23) min, while sedation failed in 92 patients. Cyanotic heart disease, history of sedation failure, history of congenital heart disease surgery, and fever were independent risk factors for sedation failure. Most of the patients in this study had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade of IIto III, but no severe adverse reactions were observed. Intranasal sedation with a combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine is effective and appears to have an acceptable safety profile for young children during transthoracic echocardiography.

AB  - Youth involved in child welfare services (CWS) are at elevated risk for substance use. CWS involvement may provide an opportunity for intervention to prevent subsequent use; however, little is known about mitigating substance use risk in this population. Using data from the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II), the present study examined individual, psychological, and contextual risk factors (e.g., prior substance use, depression, posttraumatic stress, maltreatment experiences) and protective factors (e.g., caregiver monitoring, peer relationships) following CWS involvement (Wave 1) in relation to alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine use 36 months later (Wave 3). The nationally-representative sample of CWS-involved youth was restricted to individuals who were aged 11 years or older at Wave 1 and had at least a partial interview at Wave 3 (N = 763). Three logistic regression models showed that Wave 1 substance use increased the likelihood of marijuana and cocaine use at Wave 3 [marijuana OR = 1.41 (1.19–1.68); cocaine OR = 1.26 (1.07–1.50)] but not binge alcohol use [OR = 1.44 (0.95–2.19)]. Other risk and protective factors had limited predictive value for Wave 3 substance use. The present findings suggest that initiating substance use prior to or at the time of CWS involvement is a critical risk factor for later substance use. Substance use screening and referral to treatment is imperative for CWS-involved youth.

AB  - Cocaine addiction is characterized by dysfunction in reward-related brain circuits, leading to maladaptive motivation to seek and take the drug. There are currently no clinically available pharmacotherapies to treat cocaine addiction. Through a broad screen of innate immune mediators, we identify granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) as a potent mediator of cocaine-induced adaptations. Here we report that G-CSF potentiates cocaine-induced increases in neural activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex. In addition, G-CSF injections potentiate cocaine place preference and enhance motivation to self-administer cocaine, while not affecting responses to natural rewards. Infusion of G-CSF neutralizing antibody into NAc blocks the ability of G-CSF to modulate cocaine’s behavioral effects, providing a direct link between central G-CSF action in NAc and cocaine reward. These results demonstrate that manipulating G-CSF is sufficient to alter the motivation for cocaine, but not natural rewards, providing a pharmacotherapeutic avenue to manipulate addictive behaviors without abuse potential.                   Cocaine addiction is accompanied by dysfunction in neural circuits related to reward, but it is unclear how these adaptations occur. Here, authors identify granulocyte-colony stimulating factor as a potent mediator of cocaine-induced adaptations, and show that it can alter the motivation for cocaine.

AB  - This study seeks to examine heterogeneity in developmental patterns of ecstasy use during adolescence and early adulthood among juvenile offenders and identify risk factors predicting development. Group-based trajectory modeling was utilized to elucidate heterogeneity in developmental patterns of ecstasy use. Multinomial logistic regression was utilized to identify covariates that affected the risk of assignment to groups elucidated in the trajectory model. A five-group model was found to best fit the ecstasy use data. Baseline measures of deviant peer association, self-control, other drug use, and race were identified as important risk factors predicting patterns of development. Risk of ecstasy use may be greatest for some juvenile offenders during critical periods of the life course and some social and personal characteristics that may elevate risk. Stability that is characteristic of self-control may be highly relevant for predicting persistent ecstasy use during adolescence and early adulthood.

AB  - Background: Epidemiologic studies show that cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript prepropeptide (CARTPT) gene polymorphism modifies diet-obesity relationships. However, the interaction between CARTPT gene polymorphism and diet quality indices have not been investigated yet. The current study was aimed to evaluate the interaction between major dietary indices including Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 and CARTPT gene rs2239670 variants among apparently healthy obese Iranians.                     Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out by employing 288 apparently healthy obese adults aged 20–50 years with a BMI of 30–40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Diet quality was evaluated by Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) and Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) using a 132-items semi-quantitative validated food frequency questionnaire. The CARTPT gene rs2239670 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) technique. Blood concentrations of glycemic markers, lipid profile, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) were also measured. ANCOVA multivariate interaction model was used to analyze gene-diet interactions.                     Results: The significant interactions were identified between CARTPT gene polymorphism and HEI, affecting BMR (P<sub>Interaction</sub>= 0.003), serum glucose (P<sub>Interaction</sub>= 0.009) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL concentrations (P<sub>Interaction</sub>= 0.03) after adjusting for the effects of sex and age. Also we found gene-diet interaction between CARTPT genotypes and DQI-I in terms of fat mass (FM; P<sub>Interaction</sub>= 0.02), waist circumference (WC; P<sub>Interaction</sub>&lt; 0.001), body mass index (BMI; P<sub>Interaction</sub>&lt; 0.001), basal metabolic rate (BMR, P<sub>Interaction</sub>&lt; 0.001), serum fasting glucose (P<sub>Interaction</sub>&lt; 0.01) and AgRP (P<sub>Interaction</sub>= 0.05) in individuals even after adjusting for potential confounders.                     Conclusion: Current study showed the effects of interaction between CARTPT genotype with adherence to HEI and DQI-I scores on obesity-related anthropometric and metabolic risk-factors.

AB  - We report here the involvement of the stress-responsive glucocorticoid receptor co-chaperone FKBP51 in the mechanism of in vivosecretion of mature BDNF (mBDNF). We used a novel method combining brain microdialysis with a capillary electrophoresis-based immunoassay, to examine mBDNF secretion in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in vivoin freely moving mice. By combining optogenetic, neurochemical (KCl-evoked depolarization), and transgenic (conditional BDNF knockout mice) means, we have shown that the increase in extracellular mBDNF in vivois determined by neuronal activity. Withal, mBDNF secretion in the mPFC of mice was stimulated by a systemic administration of S-ketamine (10 or 50 mg/kg) or S-hydroxynorketamine (10 mg/kg).

We included the comorbidities of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) as comorbid factors. Depression was evaluated based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM5). Duration of use, dosage of ketamine and the OSPIscores were subjected to log transformation because of the skewed distribution. Among 143 participating ketamine users, 25 (17.5%) had LUTS. Duration of ketamine use was significantly positively correlated with OSPIscores (adjusted β [95% CI], 0.21 [0.06–0.35] in log‐log model), which equaled a 10% increase in months of ketamine‐use increased OSPIscores by 2.02 %. Female and depression were significantly associated OSPIscores (adjusted β [95% CI], 0.20 [0.03–0.37], 0.49 [0.29–0.70], respectively in the log‐linear model), with OSPIscores being 1.22 times higher in female, and 1.63 times higher in ketamine users with depression. Dosage of use was not significantly associated with OSPIscores (adjusted β [95% CI], 0.04 [−0.12 to 0.20], P =0.64 in log‐log model), likewise with comorbid diseases (adjusted β [95% CI], 0.07 [−0.08 to 0.21], P= 0.36 in log‐linear model). Depression and longer duration of exposure to ketamine are significantly associated with the development of LUTSamong ketamine users. Early evaluation and intervention of depression should be considered in patients of ketamine‐associated LUTS.

AB  - Lasting changes in gene expression in brain reward regions, including nucleus accumbens (NAc), contribute to persistent functional changes in the addicted brain. We and others have demonstrated that altered expression of several candidate transcription factors in NAc regulates drug responses. A recent large-scale genome-wide study from our group predicted transcription factor E2F3 (E2F3) as a prominent upstream regulator of cocaine-induced changes in gene expression and alternative splicing.

AB  - The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a primary brain reward region composed predominantly of medium spiny neurons (MSNs). In response to early withdrawal from repeated cocaine administration, de novo dendritic spine formation occurs in NAc MSNs. Much evidence indicates that this new spine formation facilitates the rewarding properties of cocaine. Early withdrawal from repeated cocaine also produces dramatic alterations in the transcriptome of NAc MSNs, but how such alterations influence cocaine’s effects on dendritic spine formation remain unclear. Studies in non-neuronal cells indicate that actin cytoskeletal regulatory pathways in nuclei have a direct role in the regulation of gene transcription in part by controlling the access of co-activators to their transcription factor partners. In particular, actin state dictates the interaction between the serum response factor (SRF) transcription factor and one of its principal co-activators, MAL. Here we show that cocaine induces alterations in nuclear F-actin signaling pathways in the NAc with associated changes in the nuclear subcellular localization of SRF and MAL. Using in vivo optogenetics, the brain region-specific inputs to the NAc that mediate these nuclear changes are investigated. Finally, we demonstrate that regulated SRF expression, in turn, is critical for the effects of cocaine on dendritic spine formation and for cocaine-mediated behavioral sensitization. Collectively, these findings reveal a mechanism by which nuclear-based changes influence the structure of NAc MSNs in response to cocaine.

AB  - Poor working memory is linked to future risk‐taking behaviors. Lifelong risk of habitual drug use is highest in individuals who initiate use in early adolescence. We sought to determine in rats whether juvenile traits, specifically poor working memory and low salivary brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are related to elevated cocaine taking and relapse in adolescence and adulthood. On postnatal day (P) 20, working memory was assessed using the novel object recognition task in male and female rats. Saliva was assayed at P20 for BDNF before cocaine self‐administration on P28 [0.75 or 0.25 mg/kg/infusion for 30 days under a fixed‐ratio (FR) 1 to FR5 schedule] and on P94 before relapse after 30‐day abstinence in adulthood. A separate cohort of P28 male rats was assayed for object discrimination and BDNF in saliva and the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral striatum. Novel object discrimination correlated positively with salivary BDNF on P20 and dorsolateral striatum levels, but negatively with medial prefrontal cortex BDNF in male rats. In female rats, P20 salivary BDNF negatively correlated with object discrimination. Salivary BDNF positively correlated across age in male rats. Male rats earned more cocaine (0.75 mg/kg) at FR5 and responded more at relapse than did female rats. These elevated relapse rates in male rats were significantly associated with P20 object discrimination and salivary BDNF. Relapse after 0.75 and 0.25 mg/kg in female rats correlated only with object discrimination. In conclusion, poor working memory and low salivary BDNF in juvenile male rats may represent biomarkers for later cocaine use. Further research is needed to identify biomarkers for risk in male rats. Lifelong risk for drug abuse is highest in individuals who initiate use in adolescence. Early identification of drug use risk is therefore critical. We find that in male rats, poor juvenile working memory and low salivary brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are associated with elevated cocaine seeking in adolescence and adulthood. In female rats, only working memory is associated with later cocaine seeking. These findings suggest working memory and salivary BDNF may represent biomarkers for later cocaine abuse, although further research is needed in female rats.

AB  - Poor social behaviour and vulnerability to stress are major clinical features of stimulant use disorders. The corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) system mediates stress responses and might underlie substance use disorders; however, its involvement in social impairment induced by stimulant substances remains unknown. CRF signalling is mediated by two receptor types, CRF1and CRF2. In the present study we investigated the role of the CRF2receptor in social behaviour deficits, vulnerability to stress and related brain alterations induced by cocaine administration and withdrawal. CRF2receptor‐deficient (CRF2−/−) and littermate wild‐type mice were repeatedly tested in the three‐chamber task for sociability (i.e. preference for an unfamiliar conspecific vs. an object) and social novelty preference (SNP; i.e. preference for a novel vs. a familiar conspecific) before and after chronic cocaine administration. An in situhybridization assay was used to assess gene expression of the stress‐responsive arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) neuropeptides in the hypothalamus. CRF2receptor deficiency eliminated the sociability deficit induced by cocaine withdrawal. Moreover, CRF2−/− mice did not show either the stress‐induced sociability deficit or the increased AVP and OT expression associated with long‐term cocaine withdrawal, indicating resilience to stress. Throughout, wild‐type and CRF2−/− mice displayed SNP, suggesting that cocaine withdrawal‐induced sociability deficits were not due to impaired detection of social stimuli. These findings demonstrate a central role for the CRF2receptor in social behaviour deficits and biomarkers of vulnerability induced by cocaine withdrawal, suggesting new therapeutic strategies for stimulant use disorders.

AB  - To describe the proportion of patients reporting procedural memory following procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) with ketamine and propofol (KP) administered premixed together (ketofol) or individually (sequential KP) in ED attendees. Identify any clinical or demographic variables associated with procedural memory. This was a convenience sample of 563 patients who received KP PSA as per the departmental protocol. A standardised script was used to assess for procedural memory. This was categorised as ‘any’ and ‘unpleasant’ prior to discharge (immediate memory) and at telephone follow up (delayed memory). A total of 318 patients had sequential KP and 249 premixed 1:1 ketofol. For sequential KP compared to ketofol, the proportion reporting any memory was as follows: 3.5% versus3.3% immediate, 4.4% versus5.5% delayed and 5.4% versus7.4% for the sum of these. For unpleasant memory, the proportion was as follows: 1.6% versus2.9% immediate, 1.7% versus4.7% delayed and 2.2% versus6.9% all unpleasant memory (odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–8.1). Memory was associated with male sex (OR 4, 95% CI 1.5–10.5), opiates (OR 3, 95% CI 1.7–7.5), a Wisconsin Sedation Scale score =3 (moderate sedation) (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.1–18.2) and propofol dose <0.75?mg/kg compared to >0.75?mg/kg (13% versus3%) (OR 6, 95% CI 1.7–21). The ketofol group had 5% (95% CI 0.1–10) more respiratory events requiring intervention. Procedural memory was uncommon for both mix types; however, a greater proportion of the premixed ketofol group had unpleasant memory. Associations with sex, opiates, moderate sedation and propofol dose were identified, and respiratory adverse events were more common in the premixed ketofol group.

AB  - Cocaine addiction is characterized by alterations in motivational and cognitive processes involved in goal‐directed behavior. Recent studies have shown that addictive behaviors can be attributed to alterations in the activity of large functional networks. The aim of this study was to investigate how cocaine addiction affected the left frontoparietal network during goal‐directed behavior in a stop‐signal task (SST) with reward contingencies by correct task performance. Twenty‐eight healthy controls (HC) and 30 abstinent cocaine‐dependent patients (ACD) performed SST with monetary reward contingencies while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. The results showed that the left frontoparietal network (FPN) displayed an effect of cocaine addiction depending on reward contingencies rather than inhibition accuracy; and, second, we observed a negative correlation between dependence severity and the modulation of the left FPN network by the monetary reward in ACD. These findings highlight the role of the left FPN in the motivational effects of cocaine dependence. Motivational factors modulate left frontoparietal network in cocaine addiction. Dependence severity is negatively associated to monetary reward effects on left frontoparietal network. Monetary reward contingencies improve inhibition response times in cocaine addiction as well as in healthy controls.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that social defeat stress induces an increase in the rewarding effects of cocaine. In this study we have investigated the role played by the main hypothalamic stress hormone, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), in the effects that repeated social defeat (RSD) induces in the conditioned rewarding effects and locomotor sensitization induced by cocaine. A total of 220 OF1 mice were divided into experimental groups according to the treatment received before each social defeat: saline, 5 or 10 mg/kg of the nonpeptidic corticotropin-releasing factor CRF1receptor antagonist CP-154,526, or 15 or 30 µg/kg of the peptidic corticotropin-releasing factor CRF2receptor antagonist Astressin2-B. Three weeks after the last defeat, conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by 1 mg/kg of cocaine was evaluated. Motor response to 10 mg/kg of cocaine was also studied after a sensitization induction. Blockade of corticotropin-releasing factor CRF1receptor reversed the increase in cocaine CPP induced by social defeat. Conversely, peripheral corticotropin-releasing factor CRF2receptor blockade produced similar effects to those observed in socially stressed animals. The effect of RSD on cocaine sensitization was again blocked by the corticotropin-releasing factor CRF1receptor antagonist, while peripheral CRF2receptor antagonist did not show effect. Acute administration of Astressin2-B induced an anxiogenic response. Our results confirm that CRF modulates the effects of social stress on reinforcement and sensitization induced by cocaine in contrasting ways. These findings highlight CRF receptors as potential therapeutic targets to be explored by research about stress-related addiction problems.

AB  - Reduced eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 (eIF2)α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α) enhances protein synthesis, memory formation, and addiction-like behaviors. However, p-eIF2α has not been examined with regard to psychoactive cannabinoids and cross-sensitization. Here, we find that a cannabinoid receptor agonist (WIN 55,212-2 mesylate [WIN]) reduced p-eIF2α in vitroby upregulating GADD34 (PPP1R15A), the recruiter of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The induction of GADD34 was linked to ERK/CREB signaling and to CREB-binding protein (CBP)-mediated histone hyperacetylation at the Gadd34locus. In vitro, WIN also upregulated eIF2B1, an eIF2 activator subunit. We next found that WIN administration in vivoreduced p-eIF2α in the nucleus accumbens of adolescent, but not adult, rats. By contrast, WIN increased dorsal striatal levels of eIF2B1 and ΔFosB among both adolescents and adults. In addition, we found cross-sensitization between WIN and cocaine only among adolescents. These findings show that cannabinoids can modulate eukaryotic initiation factors, and they suggest a possible link between p-eIF2α and the gateway drug properties of psychoactive cannabinoids.

AB  - Low‐cost coal‐based carbonaceous material has attracted special attention for removal of organics from industrial wastewaters. In this study, coal tar‐derived activated carbon (AC1) and lignite activated coke (AC2) were employed to identify the fundamental factors that facilitate the selection of suitable adsorbents for removing recalcitrant organic contaminant (ROC) from bio‐treated coking wastewater (BTCW). Results show that AC2exhibited superior ROCadsorption efficiency (57.9%), which was apparently higher than that of AC1(45.2%), in spite of its lower specific surface area (238.05 m2g−1) and pore volume (0.21 cm3g−1). FTIRand XPScharacterization indicated that AC2possessed a distinctive configuration of functional groups, of which the basic oxygenic groups (60%) provided more hydrophobic adsorption sites for ROC. 3D‐EEMspectra suggested more aromatics and fluorescent materials were removed by AC2compared with AC1. GC‐MSfurther confirmed that AC2had stronger affinity with the ROCin BTCW, especially for PAHsand heterocyclic compounds. Surface chemistry is vital to the adsorption of ROCfrom coking wastewater, of which basic oxygenic functional groups have specific interactions with PAHsand heterocyclic compounds. The mechanism that best explains ROCadsorption is π–π dispersion between carbon materials and the pollutants, as well as the hydrogen‐bonding interactions. This study provides an encouraging and practical guide to ROCadsorption from BTCWin future operations. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Cocaine and crack are illicit drugs linked to numerous health issues. Despite the public health issues which these drugs present, there has yet to be an examination of the heterogeneity which exists in the developmental course of use of these drugs among a group at-risk for substance abuse: juvenile offenders. Furthermore, the role that posttraumatic stress disorder plays for predicting developmental patterns of use of these drugs has yet to be investigated either. The present research analyzed data from a sample of 1,354 juvenile offenders using group-based trajectory modeling and multinomial logistic regression to examine these phenomena. Results indicated that a five-group trajectory model best fit the data. Meeting criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder at baseline predicted assignment to the Accelerating and Moderate Chronic groups. These results indicate that juvenile offenders are at-risk for participation in cocaine/crack use and patterns of use which extend into adulthood.

AB  - Substance abuse is a pressing problem with few therapeutic options. The identification of addiction resilience factors is a potential strategy to identify new mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically. Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear sulfated polysaccharide that is a component of the cell surface and extracellular matrix. Heparan sulfate modulates the activity and distribution of a set of negatively charged signaling peptides and proteins — known as the HS interactome — by acting as a co-receptor or alternative receptor for growth factors and other signaling peptides and sequestering and localizing them, among other actions. Here, we show that stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine greatly increase HS content and sulfation levels in the lateral hypothalamus and that HS contributes to the regulation of cocaine seeking and taking. The ability of the HS-binding neuropeptide glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to increase cocaine intake was potentiated by a deletion that abolished its HS binding. The delivery of heparanase, the endo-ß-D-glucuronidase that degrades HS, accelerated the acquisition of cocaine self-administration and promoted persistent responding during extinction. Altogether, these results indicate that HS is a resilience factor for cocaine abuse and a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of cocaine addiction.

AB  - Ketamine shows promise as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of depression. The increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been associated with the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine, but the mechanism of BDNF induction is not well understood. In the current study, we demonstrate that the treatment of rats with ketamine results in the dose-dependent rapid upregulation of Bdnfpromoter IV activity and expression of Bdnfexon IV mRNAs in rat hippocampal neurons. Transfection of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) into rat hippocampal neurons similarly induces BdnfmRNA expression in response to ketamine, whereas transfection of a HDAC5 phosphorylation-defective mutant (Ser259 and Ser498 replaced by Ala259 and Ala498), results in the suppression of ketamine-mediated BDNF promoter IV transcriptional activity. Viral-mediated hippocampal knockdown of HDAC5 induces BdnfmRNA and protein expression, and blocks the enhancing effects of ketamine on BDNF expression in both unstressed and stressed rats, and thereby providing evidence for the role of HDAC5 in the regulation of Bdnfexpression. Taken together, our findings implicate HDAC5 in the ketamine-induced transcriptional regulation of Bdnf,and suggest that the phosphorylation of HDAC5 regulates the therapeutic actions of ketamine.

AB  - ABSTRACTThis article examined transition rates of young children (n= 102) from an early intervention program at the Linda Ray Intervention Program (LRIP) who had documented developmental delays and co-occurring prenatal drug exposure often coupled with verified child maltreatment. Findings indicated that there was significant group improvement from entrance to exit across all six Battelle Domains at the p< .05 level. Also, children who were enrolled for a longer period of time saw significantly better adaptive, personal-social, communication, and Battelle total scale scores at the p< .05 level. Finally, data revealed that boys were 5 times more likely than girls to be transitioned to Part B services after exit from LRIP. A longitudinal study of a subgroup of these children indicated that LRIP children who were in grades K–3 needed fewer special education services in elementary school than they needed at age 36 months, indicating a further reduction in special education needs for these children.

AB  - Repeated social defeat (RSD) increases the rewarding effects of cocaine in adolescent and adult rodents.                   The aim of the present study was to compare the long-term effects of RSD on the conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine and levels of the transcription factors Pitx3 and Nurr1 in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the dopamine transporter (DAT), the D2 dopamine receptor (D2DR) and precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) signaling pathways, and the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in adult and adolescent mice.                   Male adolescent and young adult OF1 mice were exposed to four episodes of social defeat and were conditioned 3 weeks later with 1 mg/kg of cocaine. In a second set of mice, the expressions of the abovementioned dopaminergic and proBDNF and TrkB receptor were measured in VTA and NAc, respectively.                   Adolescent mice experienced social defeats less intensely than their adult counterparts and produced lower levels of corticosterone. However, both adult and adolescent defeated mice developed conditioned place preference for the compartment associated with this low dose of cocaine. Furthermore, only adolescent defeated mice displayed diminished levels of the transcription factors Pitx3 in the VTA, without changes in the expression of DAT and D2DR in the NAc. In addition, stressed adult mice showed a decreased expression of proBDNF and the TrkB receptor, while stressed adolescent mice exhibited increased expression of latter without changes in the former.                   Our findings suggest that dopaminergic pathways and proBDNF signaling and TrkB receptors play different roles in social defeat-stressed mice exposed to cocaine.

AB  - To improve the stability of petroleum coke water slurry (PCWS), bubble-PCWS has been researched in this paper. The presence of bubble-particle complexes in the slurry helps to strengthen three-dimensional network structures of slurry and enhance the stability. In order to make sure the integratedly optimal levels of multi-factors for stability of bubble-PCWS and distinguish the primary and secondary influential factors on the stability, orthogonal experiments and range analysis have been done. The results showed that the operation conditions while preparing bubble-PCWS could greatly impact the slurry stability with the biggest difference between pour rates being about 80 percentage points under different operation conditions. The optimal operation condition for stability was the combination of aeration time of 30min, solid concentration of 65 wt%, frother dosage of 0.030 wt% of the air-dried pulverized petroleum coke, aperture size of air distribution plate of 2∼5μm and frother type of AOS, on which the bubble-PCWS possessed a perfect stability with the pour rate of more than 96%. The major factors affecting the stability of bubble-PCWS in sequence were aeration time, solid concentration and dosage of frothers. Effects of aperture size of air distribution plate and type of frothers on the stability were relatively slight within the experimental range.

AB  - Environmental stimuli associated with drug use can take on conditioned properties capable of promoting drug-seeking behaviors during abstinence. This study investigated the relative importance of the amount of reinforced responding, number of cocaine-stimulus pairings, total cocaine intake, and reinforcing effectiveness of the self-administered dose of cocaine to the conditioned reinforcing effectiveness of cocaine-associated stimuli (CS). Male rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.1 [small] or 1.0mg/kg/inf [large]) under a fixed ratio schedule of reinforcement. A progressive ratio (PR) schedule was used to quantify the reinforcing effectiveness of each dose of cocaine, as well as the conditioned reinforcing effectiveness of the CS following treatment with saline or the dopamine D2-like receptor agonist pramipexole (0.1–3.2mg/kg). The large dose of cocaine maintained larger final ratios and greater levels of cocaine intake, whereas the small dose resulted in more cocaine-CS pairings. The total amount of responding was comparable between groups. During PR tests of conditioned reinforcement, pramipexole increased responding for CS presentations in both groups; however, the final ratio completed was significantly greater in large- as compared to small-dose group. In addition to highlighting a central role for dopamine D2-like receptors in modulating the effectiveness of cocaine-paired stimuli to reinforce behavior, these results suggest that conditioned reinforcing effectiveness is primarily determined by the reinforcing effectiveness of the self-administered dose of cocaine and/or total cocaine intake, and not the total amount of responding or number cocaine-stimulus pairings. These findings have implications for understanding how different patterns of drug-taking might impact vulnerability to relapse.

AB  - Drug-induced agranulocytosis is a recognized adverse drug event associated with serious infectious complications. Levamisole is an antihelminthic and immunomodulator withdrawn from North American markets in 2005 after reports of agranulocytosis. Previous studies of levamisole, suggest that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 confers a genetic predisposition to this adverse drug event. Since 2009, emergency room visits due to agranulocytosis in individuals consuming levamisole-adulterated crack-cocaine have increased.                   We performed a case–control study using a genotyping assay and novel gene chip to test the association between cocaine-associated agranulocytosis (CAA) and HLA-B27 and to identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic gene variants associated with the phenotype.                   Fifty-one CAA cases were identified through a provincial physician reporting system between 2008 and 2011. We examined eight of these cases and 26 matched controls. Genotyping revealed a significant association between HLA-B27 and CAA (odds ratio [OR] 9.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54–54.6). We also observed a similar association with the HLA-B27 tag single nucleotide polymorphism rs4349859 (OR 9.2, 95% CI 1.5–54.6) and rs13202464 (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.1–41). Further associations were identified with variants in the ARBCC12(OR 10.0, 95% CI 2.7–36.8) and CYP11A1(OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.1–26.6) genes, while a novel protective association was observed with variants in the ARDB1gene (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.007–0.46).                   We confirmed the association of HLA-B27 with CAA and identified additional susceptibility variants. Health care providers should inform people who are identified as having CAA that it is genetically determined and can recur with continued cocaine use. The severity of infections and subsequent hospitalization, and the risk of recurrence may prompt health-promoting behaviour changes of the affected individuals. These genetic associations warrant the attention of public health and knowledge translation efforts to highlight the implications for susceptibility to this severe adverse drug event.

AB  - Many recreational ecstasy/MDMA users display neuropsychobiological de.cits, whereas others remain problem free. This review will investigate some of the drug and non-drug factors which in.uence the occurrence of these de.cits. Acute and chronic MDMA usage are both important. Intensive use within a session is often associated with more problems. In term of lifetime usage, novice users generally remain unimpaired, whereas most heavy users report memory or other psychobiological problems which they attribute to ecstasy. These complaints are con.rmed by objective de.cits in working memory, attention, frontal-executive, and episodic memory tasks. Psychobiological de.cits include disturbed sleep, sexual dysfunction, reduced immuno-competence, and increased oxidative stress. Further MDMA-related factors which may contribute to these changes, include acute and chronic tolerance, and drug dependence. Around 90ñ95% of ecstasy/MDMA users also take cannabis, and this can independently contribute to the adverse neuropsychobiological pro.les; although in some situations the acute co-use of these two drugs may be interactive rather than additive, since cannabis has relaxant and hypothermic properties. Alcohol, nicotine, amphetamine, and other drugs, can also affect the psychobiological pro.les of ecstasy polydrug users in complex ways. Pure MDMA users are rare but they have been shown to display signi.cant neurocognitive de.cits. Psychiatric aspects are debated in the context of the diathesisstress model. Here the stressor of ecstasy polydrug drug use, interacts with various predisposition factors (genetic, neurochemical, personality), to determine the psychiatric outcome. Recreational MDMA is typically taken in hot and crowded dances/raves. Prolonged dancing, feeling hot, and raised body temperature, can also be associated with more psychobiological problems. This is consistent with the animal literature, where high ambient temperature and other metabolic stimulants boost the acute effects of MDMA, and cause greater serotonergic neurotoxicity. In conclusion, the neuropsychobiological effects of MDMA are modulated by a wide range of drug and non-drug factors. These multiple in.uences are integrated within a bioenergetic stress model, where factors which heighten acute metabolic distress lead to more neuropsychobiological problems.

AB  - This study assesses patterns of use of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'), and the characteristics of users, in a sample of 733 men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City. Among respondents, 13.7% reported using MDMA in the past 6 months, with mean frequency of use of 6.24 times in that period. MDMA users were found to be younger, less educated, to have had more male partners, more one night stands with men, more visits to bars or clubs and sex clubs or bathhouses, to have unprotected anal sex with a male, to be likely to have been the victim of physical domestic violence, to have more gay/bisexual friends, to have disclosed their sexual orientation to more friends, family members, and coworkers, and to have higher levels of gay community participation and affiliation. Among MDMA users, higher frequency of MDMA use was associated with being younger, having more visits to bars or clubs, more gay/bisexual friends, and having an HIV negative test result or never having been tested. MDMA users thus constitute a group at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, and other problems. The data suggest that MDMA use is associated with being more 'out', which may be advantageous in helping gay men deal with harmful psychological effects of stigma, but may place individuals in settings that expose them to MDMA. These men have also presumably already been well exposed to safer sex messages within the gay community, thus raising challenges for interventions aimed at prevention, as well as opportunities (e.g. MSM and community specific interventions) that need to be further explored.

AB  - The analytical test-system for cocaine, benzoylecgonine and norcocaine was developed in the ELISA format using molecularly imprinted polymeric nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) as synthetic recognition elements that were produced using a solid-phase synthesis approach. The experimental conditions of the assay were optimized using a Box–Behnken experimental design protocol. The detection of free cocaine and its metabolites was performed using a competitive binding assay in the model samples and in blood plasma. There was no cross-reactivity of the developed assay towards paracetamol and caffeine. The developed assay had a picomolar limit of detection of cocaine (LOD = 4.24 pM), which was almost three orders of magnitude lower than the LOD expected from the commercial antibody-based ELISA (3.3 nM), and other attractive features of a new assay included a long shelf-life, lower economic cost and a short production time. Therefore, it is possible to state that nanoMIPs have the potential to become the recognition elements of choice for the development of a new generation of test-systems and sensors.

AB  - Prenatal cocaine exposure remains a major public health concern because of its adverse impact on cognitive function in children and adults. We report that prenatal cocaine exposure produces significant deficits in reversal learning, a key component of cognitive flexibility, in a mouse model. We used an olfactory reversal learning paradigm and found that the prenatally cocaine-exposed mice showed a marked failure to learn the reversed paradigm. Because brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key regulator of cognitive functions, and because prenatal cocaine exposure increases the expression of BDNF and the phosphorylated form of its receptor, tyrosine kinase B (TrkB), we examined whether BDNF-TrkB signaling is involved in mediating the reversal learning deficit in prenatally cocaine-exposed mice. Systemic administration of a selective TrkB receptor antagonist restored normal reversal learning in prenatally cocaine-exposed mice, suggesting that increased BDNF-TrkB signaling may be an underlying mechanism of reversal learning deficits. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the reversal learning phenomenon and may have significant translational implications because impaired cognitive flexibility is a key symptom in psychiatric conditions of developmental onset.

AB  - An antidepressant dose of the rapidly-acting ketamine inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) in mouse hippocampus, and this inhibition is required for the antidepressant effect of ketamine in learned helplessness depression-like behavior. Here we report that treatment with an antidepressant dose of ketamine (10mg/kg) increased expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) in mouse hippocampus, an effect that required ketamine-induced inhibition of GSK3. Ketamine also inhibited hippocampal GSK3 and increased expression of hippocampal IGF2 in mice when administered after the induction of learned helplessness. Treatment with the specific GSK3 inhibitor L803-mts was sufficient to up-regulate hippocampal IGF2 expression. Administration of IGF2 siRNA reduced ketamine's antidepressant effect in the learned helplessness paradigm. Mice subjected to the learned helplessness paradigm were separated into two groups, those that were resilient (non-depressed) and those that were susceptible (depressed). Non-depressed resilient mice displayed higher expression of IGF2 than susceptible mice. These results indicate that IGF2 contributes to ketamine's antidepressant effect and that IGF2 may confer resilience to depression-like behavior.

AB  - Responses to stress may be important in understanding gender differences in substance use disorders and may also be a target for development of treatment interventions. A growing body of both preclinical and clinical research supports important underlying gender differences in the corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) and noradrenergic systems, which may contribute to drug use. Preclinical models have demonstrated increased sensitivity of females to CRF and noradrenergic‐induced drug reinstatement compared with males, and, consistent with these findings, human laboratory studies have demonstrated greater sensitivity to corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) and noradrenergic stimulation in cocaine‐dependent women compared with men. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies have demonstrated increased neural response to stressful stimuli in cocaine‐dependent women compared with men as well as showing significant sex differences in the sensitivity of brain regions responsible for regulating the response to CRH. Development of interventions targeting the noradrenergic system and stress response in drug‐dependent individuals could have important clinical implications for both women and men. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In the brain, astrocytes signal to neighboring cells via regulated exocytotic release of gliosignaling molecules, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Recent studies uncovered a role of ketamine, an anesthetic and antidepressant, in the regulation of BDNF expression and in the disruption of astrocytic Ca2+signaling, but it is unclear whether it affects astroglial BDNF release. We investigated whether ketamine affects ATP-evoked Ca2+signaling and exocytotic release of BDNF at the single-vesicle level in cultured rat astrocytes. Cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding preproBDNF tagged with the pH-sensitive fluorescent protein superecliptic pHluorin, (BDNF-pHse) to load vesicles and measure the release of BDNF-pHse when the exocytotic fusion pore opens and alkalinizes the luminal pH. In addition, cell-attached membrane capacitance changes were recorded to monitor unitary vesicle interaction with the plasma membrane. Intracellular Ca2+activity was monitored with Fluo-4 and confocal microscopy, which was also used to immunocytochemically characterize BDNF-pHse-laden vesicles. As revealed by double-fluorescent micrographs, BDNF-pHse localized to vesicles positive for the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), VAMP3, and synaptotagmin IV. Ketamine treatment decreased the number of ATP-evoked BDNF-pHse fusion/secretion events (P< 0.05), the frequency of ATP-evoked transient (P< 0.001) and full-fusion exocytotic (P< 0.05) events, along with a reduction in the ATP-evoked increase in intracellular Ca2+activity in astrocytes by ~70 % (P< 0.001). The results show that ketamine treatment suppresses ATP-triggered vesicle fusion and BDNF secretion by increasing the probability of a narrow fusion pore open state and/or by reducing astrocytic Ca2+excitability.

AB  - Crack cocaine use is known to contribute to poor adherence to antiretroviral medications; however, little is known about facilitators of or barriers to effective HIV treatment use among HIV-infected crack cocaine users. We sought to identify correlates of optimal pharmacy refill adherence for antiretroviral medications and plasma HIV RNA viral load (pVL) suppression among this population.                   Data from a prospective cohort of HIV-positive people who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada, were linked to comprehensive HIV clinical monitoring and pharmacy dispensation records. We used multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects modelling to longitudinally identify factors associated with ≥95 % adherence to pharmacy refills for antiretroviral medications and pVL <50 copies/mL among crack cocaine users exposed to highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).                   Among 438 HAART-exposed crack cocaine users between 2005 and 2013, 240 (54.8 %) had ≥95 % pharmacy refill adherence in the previous 6 months at baseline. In multivariable analyses, homelessness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.58), ≥daily crack cocaine smoking (AOR: 0.64), and ≥ daily heroin use (AOR: 0.43) were independently associated with optimal pharmacy refill adherence (all p< 0.05). The results for pVL non-detectability were consistent with those of medication adherence, except that longer history of HAART (AOR: 1.06), receiving a single tablet-per-day regimen (AOR: 3.02) and participation in opioid substitution therapies was independently associated with pVL non-detectability (AOR: 1.55) (all p< 0.05).                   Homelessness, and daily crack cocaine and/or heroin use were independently and negatively associated with optimal HAART-related outcomes. With the exception of opioid substitution therapies, no addiction treatment modalities assessed appeared to facilitate medication adherence or viral suppression. Evidence-based treatment options for crack cocaine use that also confer benefits to HAART need to be developed.

AB  - Diminished adult neurogenesis is known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of diverse neurodegenerative disorders such as HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). Cocaine, often abused by HIV-infected patients, has been suggested to worsen HIV-associated CNS disease. Mounting evidence also indicates that HIV infection can lead not only to neuronal dysfunction or loss, but can also negatively impact neurogenesis, resulting in generation of fewer adult neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, brain area critical for memory and learning. The crucial role of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in providing tropic support for the neurons as well as in promoting NPC proliferation has been demonstrated by us previously. However, whether PDGF-BB regulates neuronal differentiation especially in the context of HAND and drug abuse remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that pretreatment of rat hippocampal NPCs with PDGF-BB restored neuronal differentiation that had been impaired by HIV Tat and cocaine. To further study the intracellular mechanism(s) involved in this process, we examined the role of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels in mediating neuronal differentiation in the presence of PDGF-BB. TRPC channels are Ca2+-permeable, nonselective cationic channels that elicit a variety of physiological functions. Parallel but distinct ERK, Akt signaling pathways with downstream activation of CREB were found to be critical for neuronal differentiation. Pharmacological blocking of TRPC channels resulted in suppression of PDGF-mediated differentiation and PDGF-BB-induced activation of ERK and Akt, culminating also to inhibition of PDGF-induced activation of CREB. Taken together, these findings underpin the role of TRPC channel as a novel target regulating cell differentiation mediated by PDGF-BB. This finding could have implications for development of therapeutic interventions aimed at restoration of Tat and cocaine-mediated impairment of neurogenesis in drug abusing HAND patients.

AB  - AbstractMethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) usage is synonymous with trance culture. Qualitative focus groups were conducted with eight young adults who attended trance parties but did not consume MDMA in order to explore protective factors that prevented participants from consuming MDMA. The focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed, using thematic analysis. Five main themes emerged from the analysis. These themes were named as follows: knowledge and beliefs relating to MDMA, fear of losing control, fear of sexual contact, learning from others who have consumed MDMA and self-preservation. Participants overwhelmingly stated that one of the main reasons they did not use MDMA was because it was chemical in nature. However, participants admitted to using cannabis and mushrooms and rationalised this by stating that they were natural. The researchers had difficulty in attaining participants for this study as few people attend trance parties and abstain from using MDMA.

AB  - High-dose opioid administration is associated with significant adverse events. Evidence suggests that low-dose ketamine infusions improve perioperative analgesia over conventional opioid management, but usage is highly variable. Ketamine's adverse drug effects (ADEs) are well known, but their prevalence during low-dose infusions in a clinical setting and how often they lead to infusion discontinuation are unknown. The purposes of this study were 3-fold: (1) to identify patient factors associated with initiation of ketamine infusions during spine surgery, (2) to identify specific spine procedures in which ketamine has been used most frequently, and (3) to identify ADEs associated with postoperative ketamine infusions and which ADEs most frequently led to discontinuation. Spine surgery was chosen because of its association with moderate to severe pain and a relatively high use of ketamine infusions in this population at our hospital.

AB  - The present study investigates the role of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx)‐1 gene in cocaine‐induced renal damage in mice. Multiple doses of cocaine increased lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and glutathione oxidation in the kidney of the non‐transgenic mice (non‐TGmice). The enzymatic activities of GPx and glutathione reductase were significantly decreased in non‐TGmice, whereas superoxide dismutase was increased in the early phase of cocaine exposure. Treatment with cocaine resulted in significant decreases in expression of Bcl‐2 and Bcl‐xl in the kidney of non‐TGmice, which resulted in significant increases in Bax and cleaved‐caspase 3. Consistently, cocaine‐induced tubular epithelial vacuolization and focal tubular necrosis were mainly observed in the proximal tubules in the kidneys of non‐TGmice. These renal pathologic changes were much less pronounced in GPx‐1 TGthan in non‐TGmice. These results suggest that the GPx‐1 gene is a protective factor against nephrotoxicity induced by cocaine via interactive modulations between antioxidant and cell survival signaling processes.

AB  - Cocaine has become a public health problem. Several studies have shown that cocaine addiction is associated with multiple cognitive damages, such as memory, inhibitory control, attention and executive functions. A French cohort of cocaine addicted patients was divided into two groups: CCU (Current cocaine users) and abstainers. Their cognitive abilities were compared to a control group and associations with clinical determinants were assessed. The CCU group and the abstainers had episodic memory, working memory and inhibitory control disabilities compared to the control group. Both the CCU and the abstainers group had the same cognitive abilities but their clinical determinants for these cognitive abilities differed. In the CCU group, exposure to cocaine seemed to have a negative impact on cognition especially inhibitory control, memory and impulsivity. In the abstainers group, craving and depression impeded cognition.

AB  - Background: Parkinsonism is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder, in which genetic and environmental risk factors may both play a role. Among environmental risk factors cocaine was earlier ambiguously linked to Parkinsonism. Former single case reports described Parkinsonism in chronic cocaine users, but an epidemiological study did not confirm an increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. Here we report a patient, who developed Parkinsonism in young age after chronic cocaine use, in whom a homozygous LRRK2risk variant was also detected.                     Case presentation: The patient was investigated because of hand tremor, which started after a 1.5-year period of cocaine abuse. Neurological examination suggested Parkinsonism, and asymmetrical pathology was confirmed by the dopamine transporter imaging study. The genetic investigations revealed a homozygous risk allele in the LRRK2gene. After a period of cocaine abstinence, the patient’s symptoms spontaneously regressed, and the dopamine transporter imaging also returned to near-normal.                     Conclusions: This case report suggests that cocaine abuse indeed might be linked to secondary Parkinsonism and serves as an example of a potential gene-environmental interaction between the detected LRRK2 risk variant and cocaine abuse. The reversible nature of the DaTscan pathology is a unique feature of this case, and needs further evaluation, whether this is incidental or can be a feature of cocaine related Parkinsonism.

AB  - Drug exposure results in structural and functional changes in brain regions that regulate reward and these changes may underlie the persistence of compulsive drug seeking and relapse. Neurotrophic factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF2), are necessary for neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation, and may contribute to these drug-induced changes. Following cocaine exposure, bFGF is increased in addiction-related brain regions, including the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL-mPFC). The IL-mPFC is necessary for extinction, but whether drug-induced overexpression of bFGF in this region affects extinction of drug seeking is unknown. Thus, we determined whether blocking bFGF in IL-mPFC would facilitate extinction following cocaine self-administration. Rats were trained to lever press for intravenous infusions of cocaine before extinction. Blocking bFGF in IL-mPFC before four extinction sessions resulted in facilitated extinction. In contrast, blocking bFGF alone was not sufficient to facilitate extinction, as blocking bFGF and returning rats to their home cage had no effect on subsequent extinction. Furthermore, bFGF protein expression increased in IL-mPFC following cocaine self-administration, an effect reversed by extinction. These results suggest that cocaine-induced overexpression of bFGF inhibits extinction, as blocking bFGF during extinction permits rapid extinction. Therefore, targeted reductions in bFGF during therapeutic interventions could enhance treatment outcomes for addiction.

AB  - Recreational ketamine use may be modulated by factors such as ketamine infusion patterns, associated conditioned stimuli and spatial-temporal contexts. Our aim was to study the pharmacological and non-pharmacological factors that regulate the acquisition of ketamine use.                   In experiment 1, four groups of male rats were trained to self-administer ketamine during nine 1-h daily sessions, under four reinforcement schedules: i) pre-session ketamine priming (Priming-[KET]), ii) conditioned stimulus (CS) paired to the ketamine infusions ([KET + CS]), iii) neither priming nor CS ([KET]), iv) combination of both (Priming-[KET + CS]). In experiment 2, two groups of male rats were trained to self-administer ketamine during nine 1-h daily or weekly sessions, under the Priming-[KET + CS] schedule. Lever pressing was then extinguished by saline substitution for ketamine infusion. Afterwards, ketamine was made available again upon responding under the same schedule.                   The Priming-[KET + CS] schedule of reinforcement showed a significant increase in the number of ketamine reinforcements and a significant discrimination between active vs. inactive levers. The same schedule allowed the establishment of ketamine self-administration on a weekly basis. During the extinction phase, rate of responding significantly dropped in both weekly and daily groups although it was twofold longer in the former, which showed a lack of reacquisition.                   Both pre-session ketamine priming and a conditioned stimulus paired to the ketamine infusions are required for the acquisition of ketamine self-administration. The longer extinction and the lack of reacquisition in the weekly group could be due to changes in temporal context that might affect the conditioning process.

AB  - In Brazil, crack cocaine use remains a healthcare challenge due to the rapid onset of its pleasurable effects, its ability to induce craving and addiction, and the fact that it is easily accessible. Delayed action on the part of the Brazilian Government in addressing the drug problem has led users to develop their own strategies forsurviving the effects of crack cocaine use, particularly the drug craving and psychosis. In this context, users have sought the benefits of combining crack cocaine with marijuana. Our aim was to identify the reasons why users combine crack cocaine with marijuana and the health implications of doing so.                   The present study is a qualitative study, using in-depth interviews and criteria-based sampling, following 27 crack cocaine users who combined its use with marijuana. Participants were recruited using the snowball sampling technique, and the point of theoretical saturation was used to define the sample size. Data were analyzed using the content analysis technique.                   The interviewees reported that the combination of crack cocaine use with marijuana provided “protection” (reduced undesirable effects, improved sleep and appetite, reduced cravingfor crack cocaine, and allowed the patients to recover some quality of life).                   Combined use of cannabis as a strategy to reduce the effects of crack exhibited several significant advantages, particularly an improved quality of life, which “protected” users from the violence typical of the crack culture.                   Crack use is considered a serious public health problem in Brazil, and there are few solution strategies. Within that limited context, the combination of cannabis and crack deserves more thorough clinical investigation to assess its potential use as a strategy to reduce the damage associated with crack use.

AB  - Studies have showed that prenatal cocaine exposure (PCOC) can impair cognitive function and social behavior of the offspring; however, the mechanism underlying such effect is poorly understood. Insulin-like growth factor II (Igf-II), an imprinted gene, has a critical role in memory consolidation and enhancement. We hypothesized that epigenetic regulation of hippocampal Igf-IImay attribute to the cognitive deficits of PCOC offspring. We used Morris water maze and open-field task to test the cognitive function in PCOC offspring. The epigenetic alteration involved in hippocampal Igf-IIexpression deficit in PCOC offspring was studied by determining Igf-IImethylation status, DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) expressions and l-methionine level. Moreover, IGF-II rescue experiments were performed and the downstream signalings were investigated in PCOC offspring. In behavioral tests, we observed impaired spatial learning and memory and increased anxiety in PCOC offspring; moreover, hippocampal IGF-II mRNA and protein expressions were significantly decreased. Hippocampal methylation of cytosine-phospho-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides in differentially methylated region (DMR) 2 of Igf-IIwas elevated in PCOC offspring, which may be driven by the upregulation of l-methionine and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1. Importantly, intra-hippocampal injection of recombinant IGF-II reactivated the repressed calcium calmodulin kinase II α (CaMKIIα) and reversed cognitive deficits in PCOC offspring. Collectively, our findings suggest that cocaine exposure during pregnancy impairs cognitive function of offspring through epigenetic modification of Igf-IIgene. Enhancing IGF-II signaling may represent a novel therapeutical strategy for cocaine-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - Withdrawal from chronic d-amphetamine (D-AMPH) can induce negative emotional states, which may contribute to relapse and the maintenance of addiction. Diminished levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), particularly in the hippocampus has been observed after exposure to stress, and recent data indicate that treatment with the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, ketamine may reverse these changes. However, it is unclear whether BDNF levels in the hippocampus or other regions of the limbic system are altered following the stress of D-AMPH withdrawal and it is not currently known if treatment with ketamine has any effect on these changes. The goals of this study were to examine BDNF levels throughout the limbic system following D-AMPH withdrawal and determine whether ketamine treatment would alter D-AMPH-induced changes in BDNF. Sprague–Dawley rats were treated with D-AMPH and BDNF protein examined in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and hippocampus at 24 h and 4 days of withdrawal. Our data show that at 24 h post-D-AMPH, BDNF levels were increased in the nucleus accumbens and decreased in the hippocampus. At 4d post-D-AMPH, BDNF protein levels were decreased in all areas examined, and these decreases were reversed by treatment with ketamine. These data suggest that diminished BDNF may contribute to the negative affect seen following D-AMPH withdrawal, and that ketamine treatment could offer relief from these symptoms.

AB  - AbstractBackground/Aims:Considering the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in memory processes and its peripheral response during the detoxification of cocaine, the aim of this study was to investigate whether plasma BDNF levels could be related to memory performance in women with crack/cocaine dependence. Methods:Twenty-five abstinent female crack/cocaine users (CCD) and 25 unmedicated healthy women (HW), carefully matched for age and years of formal education, were assessed regarding memory performance. Logical Memory was used to assess the immediate verbal recall (IVR), delayed verbal recall (DVR) and memory retention. Plasma BDNF levels were measured by Elisa immunoassay. Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms, and the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment the severity of cocaine abstinence symptoms. Results:The CCD group had lower DVR scores and higher plasma BDNF levels when compared to HW group. In addition, a linear regression model showed that BDNF levels predicted DVR scores within CCD group independently of depressive symptoms (R = 0.51; R2= 0.26; t(22) = 4.025, p = 0.03). Conclusion:Despite higher plasma BDNF levels, crack users exhibited memory impairments when compared to healthy women. Specifically, peripheral BDNF levels predicted better cognitive performance only within individuals who already had cognitive impairment.© 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Methylphenidate (MPH) occupies brain striatal dopamine transporters (DATs) and is an effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, patients with ADHD and comorbid cocaine dependence do not benefit significantly from treatment with MPH. To better understand the neurobiology of this phenomenon, we examined DAT availability and the effects of MPH treatment on DAT occupancy in ADHD patients with and without cocaine dependence. ADHD patients without a comorbid substance use disorder (N=16) and ADHD patients with comorbid cocaine dependence (N=8) were imaged at baseline and after two weeks MPH treatment using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with the DAT tracer [123I]FP-CIT. Changes in ADHD symptoms were measured with the ADHD symptom rating scale (ASRS). At baseline, we observed lower striatal DAT availability in ADHD patients with cocaine dependence. Following fixed MPH treatment, MPH occupied significantly less striatal DATs in cocaine-dependent than in non-cocaine dependent ADHD patients. There were no significant correlations between baseline DAT availability or DAT occupancy by MPH and ADHD symptom improvement. However, we did find significant correlations between DAT occupancy by MPH and decreases in impulsivity scores and years of cocaine use. These preliminary findings suggest that low DAT occupancy is not the reason why ADHD patients with cocaine dependence do not benefit from MPH treatment. It also suggests that higher dosages of MPH in these patients are probably not the solution and that medications directed at other pharmacological targets should be considered in these comorbid ADHD patients.

AB  - Adverse life events often precipitate the initiation of– and relapse to– cocaine use in drug‐dependent individuals. For example, acute stressors can potently exacerbate the extent to which drug‐related stimuli elicit craving to seek and procure drug, perhaps via peptidergic modulation of mesolimbic dopamine transmission. Indeed, dopaminergic signaling within nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) is critical to guiding motivated behavior in response to rewarding or aversive stimuli. The present studies, therefore, examine the site‐specific actions of the stress peptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) as a putative substrate for stress‐potentiated arousal. First, we assessed extent to which pharmacological manipulation of CRF within the NAcc alters instrumental responding for cocaine; and, in a second set of experiments, we begin to characterize the conditions under which CRF modulates local dopamine transmission. To that end, male Long‐Evans rats were trained to self‐administer cocaine intravenously under a chained schedule of reinforcement (FI‐FR) in order to dissociate appetitive (‘drug‐seeking’) from consummatory (‘drug‐taking’) behavior. Completion of a fixed interval (5min.) was followed by 10 min of continuously reinforced responding (0.4mg/kg cocaine; FR1) on another lever. After training, rats were microinjected with CRF (50 or 500ng/side) into the NAcc prior to self‐administration sessions. Microinfusion of CRF dose‐dependently increased responding during the fixed‐interval link of the chain schedule, but did not affect subsequent cocaine intake. These effects were CRF‐R2‐dependent, as CRF‐potentiated responding was prevented by pretreatment with Astressin‐2B (1000ng/side), but not CP376395 (500ng/side). Astressin‐2B was also sufficient to attenuate cocaine‐seeking responses when administered alone. Parallel microdialysis studies revealed CRF is endogenously released into the NAcc during acute stress exposure (i.e. social defeat) and, moreover, that perfusion of CRF into the NAcc is sufficient to elicit a robust increase in extracellular dopamine. Ongoing studies aim to clarify the role for CRF‐R2 in moderating this function in cocaine‐experienced rats. Taken together, these data suggest a role for CRF‐R2 in modulating appetitive drug‐seeking behavior, perhaps via interactions with NAcc dopamine, which may offer insight into the substrates of stress‐potentiated relapse. CRF‐R2 may therefore represent a worthy therapeutic target for cocaine use disorder, despite the initial clinical shortcomings of CRF‐R1‐related compounds.

AB  - AbstractThe objective of this study, which targeted long-term socially integrated cocaine users (in powder form, no heroin), was to analyze potential determinants of request for treatment for primary cocaine abuse. Two hundred and twenty-three cases (users who sought treatment for primary cocaine abuse) and 223 controls (users who did not seek treatment) were interviewed in Italy. A semistructured interview was created. Conditional logistic regression models were used. Cases had begun consuming illicit substances later, started using cocaine quicker, had high-risk drinking habits, had more intense recent use of cocaine, and used alone and at work. Some of the motivations of use that characterize subjects who seek treatment (to experience a ‘high’, disinhibition, avoidance, and to feel more confident) seem specifically to obtain immediate gratification, without concern for future consequences. Variability in cocaine abusers seeking treatment has been a long-recognized feature of this population and the results show that the appropriate target population (cocaine users experiencing problems and using more frequently) is reached by treatment services.Copyright © 2012 S.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in cocaine craving in humans and drug seeking in rodents. Based on this, the aim of this study was to explore the possible role of serum BDNF in cocaine relapse in abstinent addicts. Forty cocaine dependent subjects (DSM-IV criteria) were included in an inpatient 2 weeks abstinence program. Organic and psychiatric co-morbidities were excluded. Two serum samples were collected for each subject at baseline and at after 14 abstinence days. After discharge, all cocaine addicts underwent a 22 weeks follow-up, after which they were classified into early relapsers (ER) (resumed during the first 14 days after discharge,) or late relapsers (LR) (resumed beyond 14 days after discharge). The only clinical differences between groups were the number of consumption days during the last month before detoxification. Serum BDNF levels increased significantly across the 12 days of abstinence in the LR group (p=0.02), whereas in the ER group BDNF remained unchanged. In the ER group, the change of serum BDNF during abstinence negatively correlated with the improvement in depressive symptoms (p=0.02). These results suggest that BDNF has a role in relapse to cocaine consumption in abstinent addicts, although the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain to be clarified.

AB  - Studies have suggested that ketamine, a nonselective NMDA receptor antagonist, could be a new drug in the treatment of major depression, but the way ketamine presents such effects remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to evaluate the effects of ketamine treatment on parameters related to depression in the brain of adult rats subjected to an animal model of depression. The animals were divided into: non-deprived + saline; non-deprived + ketamine; deprived + saline; deprived + ketamine. Treatments involving ketamine (15 mg/kg) were administered once a day during 14 days in the animal’s adult phase. After treatment, the brain derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, oxidative stress and energy metabolism activity were evaluated in brain structures of rats involved in the circuit of depression. In the amygdala, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens (NAc), a reduction in BDNF levels was observed in deprived rats, but the animals treated with ketamine reversed the effects of this animal model only in the amygdala and NAc. In addition to this, the complex I activity, in deprived rats, was diminished in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala; in the PFC and hippocampus, the complex II-III was diminished in deprived rats; still the administration of ketamine increased the complex IV activity in the PFC and amygdala of rats submitted to the maternal deprivation. In deprived rats, the creatine kinase activity was reduced in the PFC and amygdala, however the administration of ketamine reversed this decrease in the amygdala. The malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalents were increased in non-deprived rats treated with ketamine in the PFC and NAc. Carbonyl levels in the PFC were diminished in control rats that received saline. Though ketamine treatment reversed this effect in deprived rats in the PFC and hippocampus. Still, in NAc, the carbonyl levels were diminished in deprived rats. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was increased in control rats that received ketamine in the PFC and NAc, and were diminished in deprived rats that received saline or ketamine in the PFC and hippocampus. These findings may help to explain that dysfunctions involving BDNF, oxidative stress and energy metabolism within specific brain areas, may be linked with the pathophysiology of depression, and antidepressant effects of ketamine can be positive, at least partially due to the control of these pathways.

AB  - During adolescence, the brain is maturing and more sensitive to drugs of abuse that can influence its developmental trajectory. Recently, attention has been focused on basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) given that its administration early in life enhances the acquisition of cocaine self-administration and sensitization at adulthood (Turner et al. (Pharmacol Biochem Behav 92:100–4, 2009), Clinton et al. (Pharmacol Biochem Behav103:6–17, 2012)). Additionally, we found that abstinence from adolescent cocaine exposure long lastingly dysregulates FGF-2 transcription (Giannotti et al. (Psychopharmacology (Berl) 225:553–60, 2013 ).                   The objectives of the study are to evaluate if (1) a single injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg) at postnatal day 35 alters FGF-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and (2) the first injection influences the trophic response to a second injection (10 mg/kg) provided 24 h or 7 days later.                   We found regional differences in the FGF-2 expression pattern as either the first or the second injection of cocaine by themselves upregulated FGF-2 mRNA in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens while downregulating it in the hippocampus. The first injection influences the trophic response of the second. Of note, 24 h after the first injection, accumbal and hippocampal FGF-2 changes produced by cocaine in saline-pretreated rats were prevented in cocaine-pretreated rats. Conversely, in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus 7 days after the first injection, the cocaine-induced FGF-2 changes were modified by the subsequent exposure to the psychostimulant.                   These findings show that a single cocaine injection is sufficient to produce enduring changes in the adolescent brain and indicate that early cocaine priming alters the mechanisms regulating the trophic response in a brain region-specific fashion.

AB  - SignificanceThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER), although functioning as protein synthesis machinery in the cell, plays other important roles that have yet to be fully unveiled. We found here that the ER can directly send an envoy protein, the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), to the nuclear envelope (NE), where the Sig-1R begins to recruit chromatin-remodeling molecules through the NE integral protein emerin to control gene transcription. Thus, the Sig-1R represents a molecule that shapes the functional connection between the NE and the DNA. We also demonstrate in this study that cocaine, a Sig-1R agonist, down-regulates the critical enzyme monoamine oxidase B that influences the cocaine-induced dopamine level in a dopamine transporter-independent manner via this never-before-described, to our knowledge, Sig-1R-linked genomic action of cocaine.

AB  - The current study aimed to elucidate the role of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and neurotransmitter efflux in explaining variability in (±) 3, 4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) self‐administration in rats. PKprofiles of MDMAand its major metabolites were determined after the administration of 1.0 mg/kg MDMA(iv) prior to, and following, the acquisition of MDMAself‐administration. Synaptic levels of 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5HT) and dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens were measured following administration of MDMA(1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, iv) using in vivomicrodialysis and compared for rats that acquired or failed to acquire MDMAself‐administration. Effects of the 5HTneurotoxin, 5,7 dihydroxytryptamine (5, 7‐DHT), on the acquisition of MDMAand cocaine self‐administration were also determined. In keeping with previous findings, approximately 50% of rats failed to meet a criterion for acquisition of MDMAself‐administration. The PKprofiles of MDMAand its metabolites did not differ between rats that acquired or failed to acquire MDMAself‐administration. MDMAproduced more overflow of 5HTthan DA. The MDMA‐induced 5HToverflow was lower in rats that acquired MDMAself‐administration compared with those that did not acquire self‐administration. In contrast, MDMA‐induced DAoverflow was comparable for the two groups. Prior 5,7‐DHTlesions reduced tissue levels of 5HTand markedly increased the percentage of rats that acquired MDMAself‐administration and also decreased the latency to acquisition of cocaine self‐administration. These data suggest that 5HTlimits the initial sensitivity to the positively reinforcing effects of MDMAand delays the acquisition of reliable self‐administration.

AB  - Crack/cocaine and engagement in risky sexual behavior represent important contributors to the escalation of the HIV infection among women. Several lines of research have emphasized the role of social factors in women’s vulnerability for such practices and stressed the importance of understanding such factors to better inform prevention efforts and improve their effectiveness and efficiency. However, few studies have attempted to pinpoint specific social/contextual factors particularly relevant to high-risk populations such as female crack/cocaine users. Extensive previous research has related the experience of social rejection to a variety of negative outcomes including, but not limited to, various forms of psychopathology, self-defeating, and self-harm behavior. Motivated by this research, the current study explored the role of laboratory-induced social rejection in moderating the relationship between gender and risky sexual behavior among a sample of crack/cocaine users (n= 211) at high risk for HIV. The results showed that among women, but not among men, experiencing social rejection was significantly associated with a greater number of sexual partners. Further, experiencing social rejection was not related to the frequency of condom use. Implications for future research, prevention, and treatment are discussed.

AB  - IntroductionNeurotrophic factors (NFs) have been investigated in the pathophysiology of alcohol and drug dependence.1–4Because preclinical evidence has suggested a potential role of these endogenous peptides in mediating the behavioural effects related to substance administration5and drug-induced neuroadaptation,6recent studies have explored neurotrophin expression in humans4,7,8to better comprehend the neurobiological and circuit underpinnings of addiction.Neurotrophic factors play a central role in brain development and are known for their role in mediating neuronal plasticity and neuronal growth in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In addition, in adulthood, NFs are important for synaptic plasticity and dendritic growth and are essential for the consolidation of long-term memory.9The NF family includes neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT4/5), and glia family ligands, such as glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF).10In addition to neurons, NFs are produced by distinct cell types, including immune cells, adipocytes and endocrine and endothelial cells, thus being in a position to affect and integrate neural, immune and endocrine system functioning.11Substantial evidence has shown that NFs also interact with neurotransmitter systems.12,13Their effects on dopaminergic neuronal function in particular may be a critical path for drug addiction because the dopamine (DA) system is a key component of the brain circuitry of motivation and reward.14–16Preclinical investigations have demonstrated that cocaine administration can increase the levels of BDNF in rodents.17,18Furthermore, recent studies have shown a significant increase in BDNF levels over the first days of cocaine abstinence in both preclinical and clinical models, which is most likely due to compensatory mechanisms activated in response to the neurotoxic effects of chronic cocaine exposure.4,19Levels of BDNF following cocaine detoxification also have predictive value for the loss of control measures affecting craving and relapse.2,8However, contrary to the BDNF findings, data from human and animal studies have shown decreased NGF levels after both heroin and cocaine withdrawal.3,6These data indicate that NF expression may be impacted differently within drug abstinence periods.Childhood maltreatment is a robust risk factor for drug addiction, and a variety of studies have shown a biological embedding of early life experiences.20–22Data from rodents and nonhuman primates suggest that changes in plasma levels of neurotrophins might function as peripheral markers of early adversity, being differentially affected by changes in the rearing environment.23Specifically, increased peripheral levels of NGF and overall reduced BDNF levels have been observed in monkeys experiencing maternal separation.23Accordingly, some authors have suggested that NF changes could be related to early life stress (e.g., exposure to childhood sexual abuse), which drives a developmental programming of neuroendocrine systems implicated in vulnerability to later mood disorders24or drug addiction.25To our knowledge, this is the first investigation that includes a comprehensive assessment of NFs in women with crack cocaine dependence during the early stages of abstinence. Most clinical studies have investigated only the expression of specific neurotrophins, particularly BDNF and NGF, in relation to ongoing drug use, and there are very few reports regarding the consequences of early life stress exposure on NF expression. Therefore the aim of our study was to assess plasma levels of BDNF, NGF, NT3, NT4/5 and GDNF during 3 weeks of early abstinence in women with crack cocaine dependence with and without a history of childhood sexual abuse in comparison to healthy controls.MethodsParticipantsWe conducted a follow-up study including a convenience sample of women with crack cocaine dependence recruited after admission to a 3-week, locked detoxification treatment facility for women with drug and alcohol dependence. We further separated these women into 2 groups based on the presence (CSA+ group) or absence (CSA− group) of a history of childhood sexual abuse.Inpatients had no access to alcohol, cigarettes or drugs during treatment. In addition, all patients had a prescribed symptomatic cocaine detoxification protocol that included neuroleptics, antidepressants and mood stabilizers. The inclusion criteria for were as follows: age 18–55 years; diagnosis of a substance use disorder, physiologic dependence of crack cocaine type; absence of self-reported comorbid psychotic syndromes; a minimum of 4 years of formal education; and absence of severe medical conditions. We excluded individuals who were found to have previously undetected psychotic symptoms after a psychiatric interview; those who were found to have neurologic diseases, infectious or metabolic disorders after medical assessment; and those with any severe cognitive deficits that resulted in an altered state of consciousness or agitation and use of benzodiazepines.In addition, we also recruited unmedicated, healthy, age-matched control participants from among 90 volunteers selected by convenience sampling. We excluded from the control group any individuals with past or current axis I disorders, history of childhood maltreatment, severe or unstable clinical illness, neurologic disorder, or any psychoactive substance use in the 30 days preceding the study.Clinical assessmentWe used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID I)26to determine the participants’ diagnoses and comorbid syndromes. History of childhood sexual abuse was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)27and was classified from moderate to extreme according to the cutoff point postulated by Bernstein and colleagues28for adult women. We evaluated the severity of depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II),29and we rated the severity of abstinence symptoms using the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CCSA).30The BDI-II and CSSA were administered after 4 days of detoxification and then repeated once a week for the subsequent 2 weeks (for a total of 3 assessments).The Addiction Severity Index (ASI-6)31,32is a semistructured interview that was administered to assess multiple dimensions of the severity of substance use problems and the pattern of substance use, including the frequency, quantity and severity of drug use for multiple substances. The ASI-6 also assesses the severity of problems in the following domains: health, legal, occupational, sociofamilial, psychiatric and use of alcohol. An expert psychiatrist (J.C.P.) and 3 well-trained psychologists (T.W.V. and S.G.T., as well as I.A.F. [not among the authors]) administered all of the clinical assessments. The ethical committee of all the enrolled institutions approved our study protocol, and all of the participants provided written informed consent.Plasma neurotrophic factor levelsBlood was collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes from 11 am to 11:30 am, 3 hours after the participants’ last meal. Participants with crack dependence had their plasma collected on the fourth, eleventh and eighteenth day of the detoxification period. We started collecting blood 4 days after admission since acute intoxication could be a problem for many participants in the first 3 days of treatment. The blood was separated within 30 minutes, and the supernatant was stored at −80°C for up to 6 months. We measured the plasma levels of BDNF, NGF, GDNF, NT3 and NT4/5 using a commercially available immunoassay enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were assayed in duplicate. All plasma NF levels are expressed as picograms per millilitre. The detection limits were 5 pg/mL for BDNF and 10 pg/mL for NGF, GDNF, NT3 and NT4/5.Statistical analysisThe distributions of all variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilks test. The demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables were examined using χ2tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA), as appropriate. The distributions of the ASI-6 variables and subscales failed tests of normality; thus, they were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test. We examined the BDI-II and CSSA variables using unpaired ttests. Regarding NGF, NT3, NT4/5 and GDNF, the data were log-transformed to improve normality. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA), including group as a between-subjects factor and covarying for age and body mass index (BMI) were used to analyze single parameters in each point of assessment.To examine NF differences between the CSA+ and CSA−groups during follow-up, we performed univariate repeated-measures ANCOVAs, covarying for age, BMI and depression severity change [BDI-II scores: ((time3 − time1) ÷ time1) × 100]. Bonferroni adjustments were used for pairwise comparisons with an α of 0.05. We selected the covariates based on evidence that plasma levels of BDNF decrease significantly with increasing age or weight33and that depression score changes are correlated to changes in BDNF levels.34We performed all statistical analyses using SPSS version 20.0.ResultsOur sample included 104 women (22 in the CSA+ group and 82 in the CSA− group) with crack cocaine dependence and 20 controls. The demographic, clinical and psychosocial characteristics of participants are summarized in Table 1and Table 2. All groups were similar in age, BMI and menstrual cycle stage. There was no significant effect of menstrual cycle stage on any NF levels in any group. There were no significant effects of a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis on NF levels for either group of women with crack cocain dependence. No significant associations were found between pharmacotherapy use and GDNF, NGF and NT4/5 measures (all p> 0.05, assessed by ttest). However, the use of neuroleptics and antidepressants was independently associated with higher levels of BDNF on day 18 and with higher levels of NT3 on days 4, 11 and 18 (all p< 0.05) in women with crack cocaine dependence, regardless of CSA subgroup. Nevertheless, both CSA groups were homogeneous regarding medication and comorbid diagnoses.The CSA+ group had significantly greater psychiatric impairment according to the AIS-6 subscale scores and also reported significantly more hospital admissions owing to relapse in the 6 months preceding the study than the CSA−group. Conversely, the pattern of crack cocaine use, age at onset of drug use and number of days of withdrawal before being admitted for treatment were similar between these 2 groups. The patterns of marijuana and alcohol use were also similar. In addition, the groups were very similar regarding severity of depressive and withdrawal symptoms during early abstinence, despite the marginally increased effect that could be perceived in the CSA+ group after 18 days of detoxification. Altogether these findings suggest that women in the CSA+ group may have been more vulnerable to the impact of crack consumption but that the important clinical variables that could impact NF levels were controlled.To evaluate the role of childhood sexual abuse in women with crack cocaine dependence, we used a repeated-measures multivariate general linear model adjusted for age and BMI for each NF. These analyses revealed a statistically significant group × time interaction effect for GDNF (F2, 130= 8.46, p= 0.001; Mauchly’s W = 0.88, Greenhouse–Geisser-corrected, p= 0.001) and NT4/5 levels (F2, 138= 4.44, p= 0.013; Mauchly’s W = 0.93, Greenhouse–Geisser-corrected, p= 0.90) during the detoxification period. Furthermore, we identified a significant general effect of time for NGF levels (F2,65= 3.76, p= 0.026; Mauchly W = 0.93, p= 0.10) during detoxification, regardless of history of childhood sexual abuse; however, this result did not remain significant after pairwise comparisons. There were no significant effects of group or time on BDNF and NT3 levels in this analysis (Fig. 1).To investigate whether the GDNF and NT4/5 effects are best predicted by severity of crack cocaine addiction, by childhood sexual abuse or by medication, we performed a stepwise multiple linear regression, including sexual abuse score (CTQ), severity of drug addiction (ASI-6), use of medication, age and BMI, predicting GDNF and NT4/5 plasma levels after 3 weeks of detoxification. Only childhood sexual abuse (B = 0.27, p= 0.012) and BMI (B = 0.23; p= 0.031) were included in the equation predicting GDNF after treatment [R= 0.36, R2= 0.13; F1,74= 4.81, p= 0.031].In general we found reduced GDNF and NGF plasma levels and a sustained increase in BDNF levels during early abstinence in women with crack dependence compared with controls. The ANCOVAs, adjusted for age and BMI, showed that at 4 days of detoxification, both the CSA+ and CSA− groups presented lower levels of GDNF than the control group (F2, 107= 3.79; p= 0.26). At the eleventh day, however, GDNF increased in the CSA+ group, while GDNF levels in the CSA− group remained reduced compared with controls (F2, 111= 9.74, p< 0.001). The GDNF levels continued to increase for the CSA+ group after 18 days of detoxification (F2, 105= 12.20, p< 0.001; Fig. 1A). Since there were differences regarding relapse history between these 2 groups, we compared the fractional GDNF change [(time2 − time1 ÷ time2 × time1) × 100] in the second and third week of follow-up regardless of whether they had prior hospital admissions owing to relapse, and we did not find any significant association (data not shown). In addition, both the CSA+ and CSA− groups exhibited a sustained increase in BDNF levels compared with controls since they showed higher plasmatic concentrations at 4 days (F2, 109= 8.15, p= 0.001), 11 days (F2, 113= 5.36, p= 0.006) and 18 days (F2, 112= 5.49, p= 0.005) of detoxification (Fig. 1B). Conversely, we identified lower levels of NGF in both the CSA+ and CSA− groups compared with the control group at 4 days (F2, 108= 13.0, p< 0.001), 11 days (F2, 109= 12.5, p< 0.001) and 18 days (F2, 101= 11.95, p< 0.001; Fig. 1C). Moreover, there were no differences among the groups in levels of NT3 (all p> 0.05; Fig. 1D), although NT4/5 levels were found to be higher in the CSA+ group than the CSA− group at the end of detoxification (Fig. 1E).DiscussionThis study investigated several NFs during early abstinence in women with crack cocaine dependence with and without a history of childhood sexual abuse and in a group of healthy controls. Overall GDNF, NGF, NT-3 and NT4/5 levels were lower in women with crack cocaine dependence than controls at all time points, whereas levels of BDNF were higher. However, we found that GDNF plasma levels in women with crack cocaine dependence who reported a history of childhood sexual abuse increased dramatically during 3 weeks of detoxification, whereas those without a history of childhood sexual abuse showed lower and stable levels of GDNF under the same conditions of detoxification.Glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor is the most prominent member of the transforming growth factor-β1 superfamily. It is a potent survival and differentiation factor for dopaminergic neurons during development and is the first —and so far the only — NF that can rescue dopaminergic neurons from degeneration in adults.35Long-term exposure to cocaine diminishes the dopaminergic components of the striatum and midbrain.36There is also evidence suggesting that smoking crack cocaine carries a higher risk of neurotoxicity than cocaine use alone.37Therefore, an increase in GDNF could be associated with a compensatory mechanism operating during detoxification. Such an increase, however, was detected only in the CSA+ group. Relevant for this specific finding, animal models of early life stress have been associated with reduced DA transporter binding in the ventral striatum, elevated baseline DA levels and increased DA release in response to acute stress, which were all correlated with enhanced sensitivity to cocaine in adulthood.38In addition, when the neuroprotective effects of exercise were investigated in a rat model of Parkinson disease, rats exposed to early life stress showed a reduced adaptive response associated with neuroprotection in the striatum, a major target of DA neurons.39Furthermore, maternal separation has been related to 50% reduction of GDNF concentration in the cerebellum of mice,40and it has been shown to alter the dopaminergic system by reducing surface expression of the DA active transporter and its affinity, increasing the amount of time required to clear DA from the extracellular fluid in the striatum.41Interestingly, when abstaining patients with cocaine dependence and a history of childhood adversity were compared with those who did not report early adverse family experiences, those with early life adversity exhibited reduced levels of the DA metabolite homovanillic acid and higher levels of prolactin, cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone.42,43Altogether, these data support the idea that early life stress could be related to DA dysfunction in adulthood, which could help explain our GDNF results. Supporting this hypothesis, data from monkeys exposed to methamphetamine for 2 days at either a young age, an adult age or at midgestation demonstrated that at midgestation and in adulthood, DA neurons were susceptible to methamphetamine-induced damage. However, DA neurons in young animals appeared totally resistant to the treatment, and the authors suggested that elevated levels of GDNF, which were detected only in young animals, could explain this neuroprotective effect.44Interestingly, when GDNF was overexpressed in the nucleus accumbens of mice, only chronic stressed animals exhibited an increase in social interaction and sucrose preference,45reflecting an association between chronic stress, GDNF expression and reward system. In addition, activation of the GDNF pathway results in synaptic remodelling and alterations in the responsiveness of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, which leads to an attenuation of biochemical and behavioural changes observed upon exposure of psychostimulants.46Despite the absence of a clear explanation of why GDNF plasma level in the CSA+ group was higher than than in the CSA− group and of why both groups had lower levels than controls, we hypothesized that GDNF levels could reflect changes in DA-related signalling associated with early life stress. In addition, we found that the severity of childhood sexual abuse predicted higher levels of GDNF after detoxification independently of age, BMI, severity of cocaine addiction and use of medication.Our finding of sustained elevation of BDNF plasma levels in women with cocaine dependence is consistent with those of many previous clinical and preclinical reports.4,6,17,19A consistent body of evidence stemming from rat models has indicated that elevated BDNF plays an important role in the enhancement of mesolimbic DA neuronal function, which could be related both to increased drug seeking behaviour/craving and to the reward effect of the drug.47The role of DA is primarily in the reinforcing effects of drugs and the motivation to obtain them. Thus, a potential effect of BDNF on DA neurons may be the neuronal plasticity and synaptic modifications induced by BDNF expression in the DA reward circuit, an essential link in the drive–reward paradox of addiction. Furthermore, it has already been suggested that elevated serum BDNF levels in individuals recovering from cocaine dependence are a predictive marker of future cocaine relapse outcomes.4In agreement with this idea, infusion of exogenous BDNF in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area (VTA) was associated with the reinstatement of cocaine seeking behaviour in rodents.18Recent reports have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying such cocaine-induced alterations of BDNF transcription in the VTA.48,49For example, BDNF messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the striatum and VTA is associated with cocaine-induced alterations in chromatin remodelling, including histone acetylation.19,48Acetylation of histone proteins produces an open chromatin conformation and increased gene transcription.50Hence, it is possible that the cocaine-induced neuronal plasticity is mediated in part by changes in the chromatin structure surrounding mesolimbic BDNF promoters, which could lead to increased BDNF transcription.17Although BDNF expression may reflect a compensatory mechanism in response to cocaine-related neurotoxicity, the effects of BDNF on cocaine withdrawal could be brain region–specific. Thus the augmented BDNF expression might regulate both the positive and negative effects of neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity in a site-specific manner.47For instance, in a rat model of depression, BDNF has an anti-depressant effect when infused into the hippocampus and a prodepressant effect when infused into the VTA.51In the same way, BDNF infusion into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex suppresses cocaine seeking despite pro–drug seeking effects of subcortical BDNF infusion.47Those results indicate that BDNF also regulates neuroadaptations that are critical in mediating or preventing cocaine-induced dysfunctional neuroadaptations in the reward system.Recent evidence suggests that cocaine addiction may involve progressive drug-induced neuroplasticity of the striatum and nucleus accumbens.52,53It has been well described that infusion of BDNF and NT4/5 in the VTA decreases cyclic adenosime monophosphate–dependent protein kinase and adenylyl cyclase activity in the nucleus accumbens, both of which are increased by chronic cocaine exposure.54In addition, BDNF and NT4/5 intrastriatal treatment can modify neurotransmitter-related gene expression when dopaminergic neurons are damaged in the rat striatum.55Therefore hypothetically the increase in BDNF and the lower level of other NFs observed in this study could be related to self-regulation mechanisms associated with cocaine withdrawal.In addition, it has been shown that neurotrophins bind to 2 different classes of receptor proteins: tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) receptors and the p75 neurotrophin receptor.56This dual system allows the transduction of different signals; cell death is signalled through p75, whereas cell survival is signalled through Trk receptors. Three Trk genes have been identified in mammals (TrkA, TrkBand TrkC). Nerve growth factor stimulates TrkA receptors, BDNF and NT4/5 stimulate TrkB receptors, and NT-3 activates TrkC and, less potently, TrkA and TrkB.57However, the activation of the same Trk receptor by different ligands seems to trigger different signalling events, because different adaptor molecules can be specifically recruited for TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC.58For example, activation of TrkB by BDNF or NT-4/5 does not always lead to identical biological effects.58In fact, occupation of TrkB by BDNF or NT-4/5 modulates the permeability of an ion channel associated with TrkB. Interestingly, it has been suggested that BDNF and NT-4/5 could be involved in some form of competition.59Therefore, the discrepancy found between the levels of BDNF and the other neurotrophins in our results could reflect different signalling cascades activated through Trk receptors.Most of the literature on BDNF has investigated its role in many psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, but data regarding other NF changes are insufficient and sometimes contradictory. A clinical study reported elevated NGF levels in older healthy participants exposed to chronic stress,60whereas other studies on major depression reported lower serum levels of NGF.61–63On the other hand, peripheral GDNF was found to be increased in patients with late-onset depression compared with controls,64whereas other studies found GDNF to be decreased in individuals with major depression.65In addition, reduced expression of GDNF and NT-3 mRNA of peripheral blood cells in patients with major depression were associated with depressive state,66whereas increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of NT-3 were found in elderly patients with major depression.67Patterns of increased versus decreased levels of peripheral NFs should be considered carefully since such changes may reflect dynamic physiologic mechanisms.It is also important to consider that altered NF expression could be a response to chronic stress. For patients with crack dependence, a 3-week period of crack cocaine withdrawal could be characterized as a chronic stress state. Therefore, the sustained elevation of BDNF plasma levels encompasses an increase in HPA axis tone in response to stress, including an altered immunoendocrine response, suggesting that BDNF is also an important biomarker of HPA axis functioning.4In addition, repeated stress might result in a long-term downregulation of NGF levels and upregulation of NT-3.68,69There is evidence that peripheral NF concentrations are associated with brain tissue expression.70Indeed, cerebral BDNF crosses the blood–brain barrier, and it has been suggested that peripheral BDNF levels are correlated with brain tissue BDNF levels in rodents.70Moreover NGF, NT3, and NT-4/5 can cross the blood–brain barrier of mice in vivo to arrive at the brain parenchyma, and peripheral administration of neurotrophins could have neurobiological effects within the central nervous system.71However, plasma BDNF has been hypothesized to behave as a state-dependent marker, while serum BDNF might signify illness.72Such differences in serum and plasma BDNF expression could explain the findings of similar studies that assessed serum BDNF levels but did not find elevated BDNF expression during the period of early cocaine detoxification in humans.3,8LimitationsIt is important to consider the limitations of our study. First, because we used convenience sampling in a women’s psychiatric unit to recruit participants, our sample included only women; therefore, we cannot conclude that our findings are applicable to men. Second, it is noteworthy that more than half of the patients with crack cocaine dependence had a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis. However, we did not find any significant effect of comorbid psychiatric disorders on NF levels. Third, some of the women with crack dependence were using neuroleptics, mood stabilizers or antidepressants, and use of these medications can impact the levels of some NFs,62,73which could partially explain the NF changes that we found. It should be noted that the 2 groups of women with crack dependence were homogeneously treated with common medications, and we did not find any significant differences between the experimental groups regarding the use of these medications. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to investigate nonmedicated inpatients during the acute phase of drug withdrawal. However, 42 patients were medication-free (12 in the CSA+ group and 30 in the CSA− group), therefore ANCOVAs including childhood sexual abuse as a between-subjects factor and covarying for age and BMI were used to analyze single parameters in each point of assessment for all NFs (data not shown). We found similar results regarding GDNF measures; we also found that NT-4/5 was higher in the CSA+ group than the CSA− group at the end of detoxification. In contrast, NT-3 levels were higher in the CSA+ group at all time points; however, this result should be interpreted with caution owing to the small size of the CSA+ sample. In sum, these effects for almost all NFs assessed seem not to be driven entirely by medication use, although the role of NT-3 in this association remains unclear. Fourth, blood samples were obtained from controls only once. Given that NF levels can be affected by many environmental factors, repeated measures would have been ideal to show that levels in controls remained constant throughout the period of study. Fifth, we did not investigate the possible confounding effects of other forms of stress during childhood, such as parental loss or other types of maltreatment. Finally, the possibility of memory bias could have influenced the retrospective rating of childhood sexual abuse exposure in the CTQ assessment. It is important to note, however, that this study was conducted with a careful methodological design that controlled for several clinical factors that could bias the results.ConclusionDespite these limitations, our study documented that during 3 weeks of early recovery from crack cocaine abuse, GDNF plasma levels increased significantly in the women with crack dependence and a history of childhood sexual abuse who behaviourally reported more impairment from crack consumption, but GDNF levels were reduced in those without a history of childhood sexual abuse. The BDNF plasma levels also remained elevated in both groups of women with crack dependence, whereas NGF remained reduced in these groups compared with the control group. Nonsignificant marginal reduction in NT-3 and NT-4/5 plasma levels could be observed in women with crack dependence. Although the BDNF results replicated previous findings, it is worth pointing out that our data showed that BDNF levels were stable and much higher in patients with crack cocaine dependence during early abstinence than at baseline. To our knowledge, however, the GDNF data are novel in humans with crack cocaine dependence. Although increased BDNF levels have previously been reported as a marker of cocaine relapse risk,4,19no clinical study has reported an association between elevated GDNF expression and drug relapse. This is important since data from rodents indicated that during the first weeks of withdrawal from cocaine self-administration, GDNF-dependent neuroadaptations in midbrain dopaminergic neurons played an important role in the development of incubation of cocaine craving and future relapse.74Further studies with larger samples and that include relapse follow-up measures are needed to support such findings, especially regarding the role of early life stress on GDNF expression and the possibility that the GDNF and other NF pathways (e.g., astrocytic basic fibroblast growth factor) may be a new and promising target for the treatment of drug addiction.

AB  - MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine) as an empathogenic drug causes neurotoxicity although the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The A2a adenosine receptor modulates the reinforcement efficacy and neurotoxicity of MDMA. A2a receptor activation inhibits Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) activation and nuclear translocation by a known mechanism. In the present study, we aimed to compare the NF-κB activity level in rat hippocampus between two doses of MDMA exposure (10 and 20 mg /kg) using either A2aR agonist (CGS) or A2aR antagonist (SCH). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to MDMA followed by intraperitoneal CGS (0.03 mg/kg) or SCH (0.03 mg/kg) injection. The hippocampi were then removed for western blot and RTPCR analyses. Administration of MDMA dose-dependently increased the expression of NF-κB both at mRNA and protein levels. We also found that administration of CGS following MDMA significantly increased the NF-κB expression especially in MDMA 20 +CGS group. By contrast, administration of the A2a-R antagonist SCH resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in NF-κB mRNA and protein. Our study results revealed that MDMA has powerful detrimental effects on expression of NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, co-administration of A2a agonist (CGS) can protect against MDMA neurotoxic effects by increasing NF-κB expression levels; suggesting a potential application for protection against the neurotoxic effects observed in MDMA users.

AB  - A number of demographic factors, psychiatric disorders, and childhood risk factors have been associated with cocaine dependence (CD) and opioid dependence (OD), but little is known about their relevance to the rate at which dependence develops. Identification of the subpopulations at elevated risk for rapid development of dependence and the risk factors that accelerate the course of dependence is an important public health goal.

AB  - We assessed mortality risk factors and excess mortality compared to the general population in two Spanish sub-cohorts of 8,825 cocaine and heroin users (CHUs) and 11,905 only cocaine users (OCUs) aged 15–49 admitted to drug treatment. Heroin use (among all cocaine users), no-regular employment and drug injection (among CHUs and OCUs), daily cocaine use and previous drug treatment (among CUs), and death before 2005 and 10years of heroin use (among CHUs) were clearly associated with higher mortality in Cox regression. Excess mortality was assessed by the directly standardized mortality rate ratio, which was higher in CHUs (14.3; 95% CI: 12.6–16.2) than CUs (5.1; 95% CI: 4.3–6.0) and in women than men, especially among OCUs (8.6; 95% CI: 7.5–10.0 vs. 3.5; 95% CI: 3.3–3.8); it decreased with age among CHUs, but did not decrease overall during 1997–2008. OCUs excess mortality was considerable and showed no signs of decline, suggesting the need for improved treatment and prevention interventions.

AB  - Decades of experimentation with a variety of pharmacological treatments have identified some effective therapies for heroin addiction but not for cocaine addiction. This may be due, at least in part, to our incomplete understanding of the factors involved in the differential vulnerability to these addictions, which are often considered mere variations of the same disorder. Indeed, the preference for one drug or another has been variously attributed to factors such as drug availability or price, to the addict’s lifestyle, or even to chance. Yet, there is evidence of substance-specific influences on drug taking. Data from twin registries, for example, suggest that a sizeable portion of the variability in the susceptibility to drug abuse is due to environmental factors that are unique to opiates or to psychostimulants. Very little is known about the nature of these environmental influences. We report here original data, based on retrospective reports in human addicts, indicating that the setting of drug taking exerts a differential influence on heroin versus cocaine use. We also review additional clinical and pre-clinical data pointing to fundamental differences in the way in which the environment interacts with cocaine relative to heroin and other addictive drugs. These findings - as well as other evidence, including the lack of pharmacological treatments effective for both cocaine and heroin addiction - support the notion that much is to be gained by taking into account the substance-specific aspects of drug addiction. At a therapeutic level, for example, it appears reasonable to propose that cognitive-behavioral approaches should be tailored in a substance-specific manner in order to allow the addict to anticipate, and cope with, the risks associated to the various environmental settings of drug use.

AB  - Cue-induced cocaine craving intensifies, or ‘incubates’, during the first few weeks of abstinence and persists over extended periods of time. One important factor implicated in cocaine addiction is the endogenous opioid β-endorphin. In the present study, we examined the possible involvement of β-endorphin in the incubation of cocaine craving. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.75 mg/kg, 10 days, 6 h/day), followed by either a 1-day or a 30-day period of forced abstinence. Subsequent testing for cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior (without cocaine reinforcement) was performed. Rats exposed to the drug-associated cue on day 1 of forced abstinence demonstrated minimal cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior concurrently with a significant increase in β-endorphin release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Conversely, exposure to the cue on day 30 increased cocaine seeking, while β-endorphin levels remained unchanged. Intra-NAc infusion of an anti-β-endorphin antibody (4 μg) on day 1 increased cue-induced cocaine seeking, whereas infusion of a synthetic β-endorphin peptide (100 ng) on day 30 significantly decreased cue response. Both intra-NAc infusions of the δ opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole (1 μg) on day 1 and naltrindole together with β-endorphin on day 30 increased cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior. Intra-NAc infusion of the μ opioid receptor antagonist CTAP (30 ng and 3 μg) had no behavioral effect. Altogether, these results demonstrate a novel role for β-endorphin and the δ opioid receptor in the development of the incubation of cocaine craving.

AB  - AbstractBackground:Cocaine-induced psychosis (CIP) is among the most serious adverse effects of cocaine. Reduced serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels have been reported in schizophrenia and psychosis; however, studies assessing the involvement of BDNF in CIP are lacking. Methods:A total of 22 cocaine-dependent patients (aged 33.65 ± 6.85) who had never experienced psychotic symptoms under the influence of cocaine (non-CIP) and 18 patients (aged 34.18 ± 8.54) with a history of CIP completed a 2-week detoxification program in an inpatient facility. Two serum samples were collected from each patient at baseline and at the end of the protocol. Demographic, consumption and clinical data were recorded for all patients. A paired group of healthy controls was also included. Results:At the beginning of the detoxification treatment, serum BDNF levels were similar in both the non-CIP and the CIP groups. During early abstinence, the non-CIP group exhibited a significant increase in serum BDNF levels (p = 0.030), whereas the CIP group exhibited a decrease. Improvements in depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI, p = 0.003) and withdrawal symptoms (Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment, CSSA, p = 0.013) show a significant positive correlation with serum BDNF levels in the non-CIP group, whereas no correlation between the same variables was found in the CIP group. Conclusions:This study suggests that BDNF plays a role in the transient psychotic symptoms associated with cocaine consumption. In the non-CIP group, the increase in serum BDNF appears to be driven by the effects of chronic cocaine consumption and withdrawal. In contrast, patients with CIP share some of the neurotrophic deficiencies that characterize schizophrenia and psychosis.Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Preclinical studies indicate that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in neuroplastic changes underlying enduring cocaine-seeking following withdrawal. However, little is known about temporal changes in serum BDNF levels or the involvement of BDNF in craving and abstinence in early-abstinent cocaine-dependent patients. Twenty-three cocaine-dependent individuals (aged 33.65±6.85 years) completed a two-week detoxification program at an inpatient facility. Two serum samples were collected for each patient at baseline and at the end of the protocol. Serum samples were also collected for 46 healthy controls (aged 35.52±9.37 years). Demographic, consumption and clinical data were recorded for all patients. Significantly lower serum BDNF levels (p<.0001) were observed for cocaine-dependent patients at baseline compared to healthy controls. Serum BDNF levels increased significantly across 12 days of early abstinence (p=.030). Baseline BDNF levels correlated with craving (p=.034). Post-detoxification BDNF levels correlated with craving (p=.018), loss of control (p<.000), abstinence measures (p=0.031), depression (p=0.036), and anxiety (p=0.036). Post-detoxification BDNF levels also had predictive value for the loss of control measure of craving. Chronic cocaine use is associated with decreased serum BDNF. A progressive increase in serum BDNF levels during early abstinence correlates with cocaine craving and abstinence symptoms and may reflect increasing BDNF levels in different brain regions. These findings suggest that serum BDNF may be a biomarker for cocaine addiction.

AB  - The goal was to identify factors that predicted sustained cocaine abstinence and transitions from cocaine use to abstinence over 24months. Data from baseline assessments and multiple follow-ups were obtained from three studies of continuing care for patients in intensive outpatient programs (IOPs). In the combined sample, remaining cocaine abstinent and transitioning into abstinence at the next follow-up were predicted by older age, less education, and less cocaine and alcohol use at baseline, and by higher self-efficacy, commitment to abstinence, better social support, lower depression, and lower scores on other problem severity measures assessed during the follow-up. In addition, higher self-help participation, self-help beliefs, readiness to change, and coping assessed during the follow-up predicted transitions from cocaine use to abstinence. These results were stable over 24months. Commitment to abstinence, self-help behaviors and beliefs, and self-efficacy contributed independently to the prediction of cocaine use transitions. Implications for treatment are discussed.

AB  - Statistical analysis is used to examine the effect of the main raw-material and process factors on coke rate and productivity for the blast furnaces at the Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Combine during the period from 2007 to July 2012. A method is developed for calculating and predicting coke rate and daily pig-iron output in the blast-furnace shop, and a combination of parameters is found to reduce coke rate and increase the productivity of the shop. The factors table which is used throughout the industry is refined for the conditions that exist in the blast-furnace shop at the ChMK.

AB  - Major depressive disorder is a devastating mental disorder. Current antidepressant medications can be effective for some patients with depression; however, these drugs exert mood-elevating effects only after prolonged administration, and a sizable fraction of the patient population fails to respond to treatment. There is an urgent need for faster-acting antidepressants with reliable treatment outcomes and sustained efficacy for individuals with depression, in particular those contemplating suicide. Recent clinical studies report that ketamine, an ionotropic glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, shows fast-acting antidepressant action, thus bringing fresh perspective into preclinical studies investigating novel antidepressant targets and treatments. Our recent studies show that the effects of ketamine are dependent on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and subsequent activation of the high-affinity BDNF receptor, TrkB. Our findings also suggest that the fast-acting antidepressant effects of ketamine require rapid protein translation, but not transcription, resulting in robust increases in dendritic BDNF protein levels that are important for the behavioral effect. These findings also uncover eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), a Ca2+/calmodulin dependent serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates eEF2 and regulates the elongation step of protein translation, as a major molecular substrate mediating the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine. Our results show that ketamine-mediated suppression of resting NMDA receptor activity leads to inhibition of eEF2 kinase and subsequent dephosphorylation of eEF2 and augmentation of BDNF synthesis. This article outlines our recent studies on the synaptic mechanisms that underlie ketamine action, in particular the properties of eEF2K as a potential antidepressant target.

AB  - The quantitative analysis of human urinary metabolites as biomarkers in wastewater streams has been used to estimate the rates of illicit drug use in the wider community. The primary underlying assumption in such studies is that a sample of wastewater is equivalent to a cumulative sample of urine. Drug metabolism in humans is predominantly enzymatically mediated, but these processes are not exclusive to the human body, and are found to occur in the environment and the sewer network. Understanding what happens to drugs and their urinary metabolites in the sewer system between the point of excretion and sampling is particularly important since it is possible that in-sewer transformation may influence final biomarker concentration. The present study uses batch experiments to measure and assess the biotransformation processes of cocaine and its two major human metabolites, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester. The activated sludge modelling framework for xenobiotic organic micro-pollutants (ASM-X) is used for model structure identification and calibration. Biotransformation was observed to follow pseudo first-order kinetics. The biodegradation kinetics of cocaine, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester is not significantly affected by the availability of dissolved oxygen. Results obtained in this study show that omitting in-pipe biotransformation affects the accuracy of back-calculated cocaine use estimates. This varies markedly depending on the in-sewer hydraulic retention time, total biomass concentration and the relative concentration of each metabolite. However, back-calculated cocaine use estimates derived from wastewater concentrations of benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester do show very close agreement if ex-vivo biotransformation of these compounds is considered.

AB  - Growth factors play an important role in brain development. Whether epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays a role in the pathophysiology of ketamine related disorders is unexplored. In this study, we examined the serum levels of EGF in chronic ketamine users as compared with healthy controls. The possible correlation between serum EGF levels with the demographic, ketamine use characteristics and psychopathological symptoms were analyzed. Sixty‐seven chronic ketamine users and 40 healthy subjects were recruited. Serum EGF levels were measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory. The serum level of EGF in the chronic ketamine users was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects (22.34 ± 4.81 pg/ml vs. 87.10 ± 2.96 pg/ml, F = 15.169, p< 0.01). The serum EGF level was negatively correlated with the current average dose of ketamine consumption per day of use (p= 0.015), and positively associated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive symptom score (p= .022). Serum level of EGF decreased in chronic ketamine users compared with healthy subjects, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of ketamine related disorders.

AB  - In Spain, crack cocaine use is silently increasing. In Barcelona, an intentional sample was selected to describe the general characteristics of this consumption. Participants were submitted to an interview and data were analyzed through qualitative research procedures. Users are young males and of low socioeconomic status and formal education. The major pattern of use is compulsive. Illegal income activities are the choice for crack cocaine or money acquisition, increasing individual and social health costs. Polydrug use is a matter of concern. Although these findings can not be generalized, they should be considered for the development of public policies to adequately address crack cocaine users’ needs.

AB  - Cocaine consumption can induce transient psychotic symptoms, expressed as paranoia or hallucinations. Cocaine induced psychosis (CIP) is common but not developed in all cases. This is the first European study on the relationship between CIP, consumption pattern variables and personality disorders. We evaluated 173 cocaine-dependent patients over 18 years; mostly males, whose average age was 33.6 years (SD=7.8). Patients attending an outpatient addictions department were enrolled in the study and subsequently systematically evaluated using SCID I and SCID II interviews for comorbid disorders, a clinical interview for psychotic symptoms and EuropASI for severity of addiction. A high proportion of cocaine dependent patients reported psychotic symptoms under the influence of cocaine (53.8%), the most frequently reported being paranoid beliefs and suspiciousness (43.9%). A logistic regression analysis was performed, finding that a model consisting of amount of cocaine consumption, presence of an antisocial personality disorder and cannabis dependence history had 66.2% sensitivity 75.8% specificity predicting the presence of CIP. In our conclusions, we discuss the relevance of evaluating CIP in all cocaine dependent-patients, and particularly in those fulfilling the clinical profile derived from our results. These findings could be useful for a clinical approach to the risks of psychotic states in cocaine-dependent patients.

AB  - There is an abundance of evidence showing that repeated use of 3,4-methlylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is associated with brain dysfunction, memory disturbance, locomotor hyperactivity, and hyperthermia. MDMA is toxic to both the serotonergic neurons and dopaminergic system. Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside with a neuromodulatory function in the central nervous system. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) plays a pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of an immune response by triggering the expression of major inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Here, we investigated the effects of the A2a adenosine receptor (A2a-R) agonist (CGS) and antagonist (SCH) on NF-kB expression after MDMA administration. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were injected to MDMA (10 mg/kg) followed by intraperitoneal injection of either CGS or SCH (0.03 mg/kg each) to animals. The hippocampi were then removed for western blot and RT- PCR analyses. MDMA significantly elevated NF-kB expression. Our results show that administration of CGS following MDMA significantly elevated the NF-kB expression both at mRNA and protein levels. By contrast, administration of the A2a-R antagonist SCH resulted in a decrease in the NF-kB levels. Taken together, these results indicate that, co-administration of A2a agonist (CGS) can protect against MDMA neurotoxic effects by increasing NF-kB expression levels; suggesting a potential application for protection against the neurotoxic effects observed in MDMA users.

AB  - Cocaine dependence is a neuropsychiatric disorder in which both environmental and genetic factors are involved. Several processes, that include reward and neuroadaptations, mediate the transition from use to dependence. In this regard, dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission systems are clearly involved in reward and other cocaine‐related effects, whereas neurotrophic factors may be responsible for neuroadaptations associated with cocaine dependence. We examined the contribution to cocaine dependence of 37 genes related to the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems, neurotrophic factors and their receptors through a case–control association study with 319 single nucleotide polymorphisms selected according to genetic coverage criteria in 432 cocaine‐dependent patients and 482 sex‐matched unrelated controls. Single marker analyses provided evidence for association of the serotonin receptor HTR2Awith cocaine dependence [rs6561333; nominal P‐value adjusted for age = 1.9e−04, odds ratio = 1.72 (1.29–2.30)]. When patients were subdivided according to the presence or absence of psychotic symptoms, we confirmed the association between cocaine dependence and HTR2Ain both subgroups of patients. Our data show additional evidence for the involvement of the serotoninergic system in the genetic susceptibility to cocaine dependence.

AB  - Our study stems from four related lines of evidence: (1) FGF-2 is expressed in the developing brain; (2) psychostimulants modulate FGF-2 expression; (3) stress alters FGF-2 expression; and (4) exogenous administration of FGF-2 long-lastingly alters cocaine acquisition of self-administration.This research aims to study the effects of adolescent cocaine exposure on FGF-2 mRNA levels and its influence on the response to stress.Rats were treated subcutaneously with saline or cocaine from postnatal day (PND) 28 to PND 42, a period that roughly approximates adolescence in humans. At PND 45 and PND 90, rats were exposed to an acute stress. Real-time PCRs were performed on total RNA extracted from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and striatum.In the prefrontal cortex, repeated cocaine treatment during adolescence increased FGF-2 mRNA levels in PND 90 rats and altered its response to an acute stress in both PND 45 and PND 90 rats. In the hippocampus of PND 45 rats, we found an increase of FGF-2 mRNA levels following repeated cocaine administration. No changes in the trophic factor gene expression were found in the striatum and nucleus accumbens.Our data show that cocaine exposure during adolescence alters FGF-2 mRNA levels throughout life in rat prefrontal cortex and modulates its response to an adverse event. These results point to FGF-2 as a potential molecular target through which exposure to cocaine early in life may dynamically and persistently alter brain homeostasis.

AB  - Ecstasy use may result in lowered mood, anxiety or aggression in the days following use. Yet, few studies have investigated what factors increase the risk of experiencing such symptoms. Ecstasy users (at least once in the last 12 months) who subsequently took ecstasy (n=35) over the period of one week, were compared on measures of mood, sleep, stress and drug use, with those who abstained from ecstasy (n=21) that week. Measures were administered the week prior to ecstasy use and one and three days following use, or the equivalent day for abstainers. Mood symptoms were assessed using the Kessler-10 self-report psychological distress scale, a subjective mood rating (1–10), and using the depression, anxiety and hostility items from the clinician-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Timeline Followback methods were used to collect information on drug use and life stress in the past month. Self-reported sleep quality was also assessed. Ecstasy use was not associated with subacute depressive, anxiety or aggressive symptoms. Rather, lowered mood and increased psychological distress were associated with self-reported hours and quality of sleep obtained during the three-day follow-up. These findings highlight the importance of considering sleep disruption in understanding the short-term mood effects of ecstasy use.

AB  - Abstract: Rationale: Cocaine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), and para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) disrupt normal thermoregulation in humans, with PMA being associated with more severe cases of hyperthermia. Harm minimization advice on how to prevent overheating depends on appropriate thermoregulatory behavior by drug users. Objectives: The purpose of the current study was to establish dose–response relationships for the effects of a number of commonly used illicit stimulants and investigate the behavioral response to increased core temperature. Materials and methods: Sprague–Dawley rats with telemetry implants were administered either saline or 4, 12, 26, 40 or 80 μmol/kg of cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, or PMA and confined to an ambient temperature of 30°C for 30 min, before being able to choose their preferred temperature on a thermally graded runway (11–41°C). Results: The increased core temperature caused by administration of cocaine, methamphetamine, and MDMA treatment led to the animals seeking the cool end of the runway to correct their core temperature, although this did not occur in PMA-treated rats. The order of potency for increasing core temperature was methamphetamine >PMA = MDMA>cocaine. This differed to the slopes of the dose–response curves where MDMA and PMA showed the steepest slope for the doses used followed by methamphetamine then cocaine. Conclusions: These results suggest that behavioral aspects of thermoregulation are important in assessing the potential of individual drugs to cause harmful increases in core temperature.

AB  - Aim: To gain more insight into the reasons and motives why people do not start taking ecstasy.Method: As part of the NeXT Study, we prospectively monitored 188 subjects who were ecstasy-naive at baseline but seemed likely to take ecstasy (MDMA) of their own accord during the course of the study. After an 11- to 26-month follow-up period, 160 respondents remained (85.1%). Among these, 65 participants started taking ecstasy (novel ecstasy users, NEUs) and 95 did not (persistent non-users, PNUs). Several times during their participation, subjects completed lists of reasons and motives for not taking ecstasy.Findings: Principal components analysis identified three main factors associated with non-use: rationality (factor score 0.491), lack of opportunity (0.229) and fear of the effects of ecstasy (0.211). At baseline, PNUs scored higher than NEUs on all three factors. For the NEUs, no significant changes occurred over the course of the study in all three factor curves. Slight shifts were seen for PNUs—the fear of effects diminished and lack of opportunity grew; scores on rationality remained constant.Conclusions: NEUs and PNUs were distinguished most clearly by their factor scores on rationality. Some valuable insights for prevention are discussed.

AB  - Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide plays a pivotal role in neuroprotection against stroke-related brain injury. However, the regulatory mechanism on CARTtranscription, especially the repression mechanism, is not fully understood. Here, we show that the transcriptional repressor neuron-restrictive silencer elements (NRSF, also known as REST) represses CART expression through direct binding to two NRSF-binding elements (NRSEs) in the CARTpromoter and intron 1 (named pNRSE and iNRSE, respectively). EMSA show that NRSF binds to pNRSE and iNRSE directly in vitro. ChIP assays show that NRSF recruits differential co-repressor complexes including CoREST and HDAC1 to these NRSEs. The presence of both NRSEs is required for efficient repression of CARTtranscription as indicated by reporter gene assays. NRSF overexpression antagonizes forskolin-mediated up-regulation of CARTmRNA and protein. Ischemia insult triggered by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) enhances NRSFmRNA levels and then NRSF antagonizes the CREB signaling on CART activation, leading to augmented cell death. Depletion of NRSF in combination with forskolin treatment increases neuronal survival after ischemic insult. These findings reveal a novel dual NRSE mechanism by which NRSF represses CARTexpression and suggest that NRSF may serve as a therapeutic target for stroke treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND:We determined the role of risk and protective factors on the trajectories of behavior problems associated with high prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE)/polydrug exposure.METHODS:The Maternal Lifestyle Study enrolled 1388 children with or without PCE, assessed through age 15 years. Because most women using cocaine during pregnancy also used other substances, we analyzed for the effects of 4 categories of prenatal drug exposure: high PCE/other drugs (OD), some PCE/OD, OD/no PCE, and no PCE/no OD. Risks and protective factors at individual, family, and community levels that may be associated with behavior outcomes were entered stepwise into latent growth curve models, then replaced by cumulative risk and protective indexes, and finally by a combination of levels of risk and protective indexes. Main outcome measures were the trajectories of externalizing, internalizing, total behavior, and attention problems scores from the Child Behavior Checklist (parent).RESULTS:A total of 1022 (73.6%) children had known outcomes. High PCE/OD significantly predicted externalizing, total, and attention problems when considering the balance between risk and protective indexes. Some PCE/OD predicted externalizing and attention problems. OD/no PCE also predicted behavior outcomes except for internalizing behavior. High level of protective factors was associated with declining trajectories of problem behavior scores over time, independent of drug exposure and risk index scores.CONCLUSIONS:High PCE/OD is a significant risk for behavior problems in adolescence; protective factors may attenuate its detrimental effects. Clinical practice and public health policies should consider enhancing protective factors while minimizing risks to improve outcomes of drug-exposed children.

AB  - Finding genetic polymorphisms and mutations linked to addictive behavior can provide important targets for pharmaceutical and therapeutic interventions. Forward genetic approaches in model organisms such as zebrafish provide a potentially powerful avenue for finding new target genes. In order to validate this use of zebrafish, the molecular nature of its reward system must be characterized. We have previously reported the use of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) as a reliable method for screening mutagenized fish for defects in the reward pathway. Here we test if CPP in zebrafish involves the dopaminergic system by co-treating fish with cocaine and dopaminergic antagonists. Sulpiride, a potent D2 receptor (DR2) antagonist, blocked cocaine-induced CPP, while the D1 receptor (DR1) antagonist SCH23390 had no effect. Acute cocaine exposure also induced a rise in the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an important enzyme in dopamine synthesis, and a significant decrease in the expression of elongation factor 1α (EF1α), a housekeeping gene that regulates protein synthesis. Cocaine selectively increased the ratio of TH/EF1α in the telencephalon, but not in other brain regions. The cocaine-induced change in TH/EF1α was blocked by co-treatment with sulpiride, but not SCH23390, correlating closely with the action of these drugs on the CPP behavioral response. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the drop in EF1α was selective for the dorsal nucleus of the ventral telencephalic area (Vd), a region believed to be the teleost equivalent of the striatum. Examination of TH mRNA and EF1α transcripts suggests that regulation of expression is post-transcriptional, but this requires further examination. These results highlight important similarities and differences between zebrafish and more traditional mammalian model organisms.

AB  - Ketamine exerts rapid and robust antidepressant properties in both animal models and depressed patients and tramadol possesses potential antidepressant effects. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important biomarker for mood disorders and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) is a high affinity catalytic receptor for BDNF.We hypothesized that tramadol pretreatment might reinforce ketamine-elicited antidepressant effects with significant changes in hippocampal BDNF and TrkB levels in rats. Immobility time of rats receiving different treatment in the forced swimming test (FST) was observed. Levels of BDNF and TrkB in hippocampus were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results showed that tramadol (5 mg/kg) administrated alone neither elicited antidepressant effects nor altered BDNF or TrkB level. However, pretreatment with tramadol (5 mg/kg) enhanced the ketamine (10 mg/kg) -elicited antidepressant effects and upregulated the BDNF and TrkB levels in hippocampus. In conclusion, tramadol pretreatment reinforces the ketamine-elicited antidepressant effects, which is associated with the increased levels of BDNF and TrkB in rat hippocampus.Ketamine exerts rapid and robust antidepressant properties in both animal models and depressed patients and tramadol possesses potential antidepressant effects.

AB  - Two pharmacological stressors commonly used in the study of stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking are central injections of the stress peptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and systemic administration of the α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine. Despite the widespread use of these stressors, the neurochemical systems mediating their ability to reinstate cocaine-seeking behaviour have not been fully characterized.The present study was designed to characterize the role, specifically, of dopamine transmission in the reinstating effects of CRF and yohimbine on cocaine seeking.Male Long-Evans rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.23 mg/kg/infusion) for 8–10 days. Subsequently, responding for drug was extinguished, and tests for CRF- (0.5 μg; i.c.v.) and yohimbine-induced (1.25 mg/kg; i.p.) reinstatement were conducted following pretreatment with the dopamine D1/5 receptor antagonists, SCH23390 (0.05, 0.1 mg/kg; i.p.) and/or SCH31966 (0.2 mg/kg; i.p.), and the D2/3 receptor antagonist, raclopride (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg; i.p.).Pretreatment with SCH23390, but not raclopride, blocked CRF-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Pretreatment with SCH23390 and SCH31966, but not raclopride, blocked yohimbine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking.These findings demonstrate that transmission at D1/5, but not D2/3, receptors mediates the reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by CRF and yohimbine.

AB  - Introduction and Aims.Crack cocaine pipe sharing is associated with various health‐related harms, including hepatitis C transmission. Although difficulty accessing crack pipes has been found to predict pipe sharing, little is known about the factors that limit pipe access in settings where pipes are provided at no cost, albeit in limited capacity. Therefore, we investigated crack pipe access among people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada.

AB  - Growth factors are critical in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity, and recent studies point to their involvement in addiction. We previously reported increased levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) in high novelty/drug-seeking rats (bred high responders, bHR) compared to low novelty/drug-seeking rats (bred low responders, bLRs). The present study asked whether an early life manipulation of the FGF system (a single FGF2 injection on postnatal day 2) can impact cocaine sensitization and associated neurobiological markers in adult bHR/bLR animals. Neonatal FGF2- and vehicle-treated bHR/bLR rats were sensitized to cocaine (7 daily injections, 15mg/kg/day, i.p.) in adulthood. Neonatal FGF2 markedly increased bLRs' typically low psychomotor sensitization to cocaine (day 7 locomotor response to cocaine), but had little effect on bHRs' cocaine sensitization. Gene expression studies examined dopaminergic molecules as well as FGF2 and the FGFR1 receptor in cocaine naïve animals, to investigate possible neurobiological alterations induced by neonatal FGF2 exposure that may influence behavioral response to cocaine. bLRs showed decreased tyrosine hydroxylase in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), decreased D1 and increased D2 receptor expression in the nucleus accumbens core, as well as decreased FGF2 in the VTA, substantia nigra, accumbens core, and caudate putamen compared to bHRs. Neonatal FGF2 selectively increased D1 receptor and FGF2 mRNA in the accumbens core of bLRs, which may contribute to their heightened cocaine sensitization. Our results suggest increased FGF2 in the mesodopaminergic circuit (as in baseline bHRs and neonatal FGF2-exposed bLRs vs. baseline bLRs) enhances an individual's susceptibility to cocaine sensitization and may increase vulnerability to drug seeking and addiction.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the individual (demographic characteristics, substance-using behaviors, emotional status, and negative outcome expectancy) and peer factors associated with ketamine use in Taiwanese adolescents. A total of 9,860 adolescents completed the self-report questionnaires without omission. Demographic characteristics, substance-using behaviors, emotional status, negative outcome expectancy, and peer factors were compared between the ketamine users and non-users using the Mann–Whitney Utest and the Chi-square test, and then significant factors were further selected for stepwise logistic regression analysis to examine the associated factors of ketamine use. Sixty-nine (0.7 %) participants reported having used ketamine in the past year. The results of logistic regression analysis indicated that ketamine users were more likely to use marijuana, smoke cigarettes, have peers using illicit drugs, and have a lower level of negative outcome expectancy regarding using ketamine than ketamine non-users. The associated factors found in this study should be taken into consideration when developing prevention and intervention programs for ketamine use in adolescents.

AB  - AbstractPrenatal cocaine exposure leads to persistent alterations in the growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus, brain regions important in cognitive functioning. BDNF plays an important role in the strengthening of existing synaptic connections as well as in the formation of new contacts during learning. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene (Val66Met), leading to a Met substitution for Val at codon 66 in the prodomain, is common in human populations, with an allele frequency of 20–30 in Caucasians. To study the interaction between prenatal cocaine exposure and BDNF, we have utilized a line of BDNF Val66Met transgenic mice on a Swiss Webster background in which BDNFMetis endogenously expressed. Examination of baseline levels of mature BDNF protein in the mPFC of prenatally cocaine-treated wild-type (Val66Val) and Val66Met mice revealed significantly lower levels compared to prenatally saline-treated mice. In contrast, in the hippocampus of prenatally saline- and cocaine-treated adult Val66Met mice, there were significantly lower levels of mature BDNF protein compared to Val66Val mice. In extinction of a conditioned fear, we found that prenatally cocaine-treated Val66Met mice had a deficit in recall of extinction. Examination of mature BDNF protein levels immediately after the test for extinction recall revealed lower levels in the mPFC of prenatally cocaine-treated Val66Met mice compared to saline-treated mice. However, 2 h after the extinction test, there was increased BDNF exons I, IV, and IX mRNA expression in the prelimbic cortex of the mPFC in the prenatally cocaine-treated BDNF Val66Met mice compared to prenatally saline-treated mice. Taken together, our results suggest the possibility that prenatal cocaine-induced constitutive alterations in BDNF mRNA and protein expression in the mPFC differentially poises animals for alterations in behaviorally induced gene activation, which are interactive with BDNF genotype and differentially impact those behaviors. Such findings in our prenatal cocaine mouse model suggest a gene X environment interaction of potential clinical relevance. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Personalized medicine requires the identification of unambiguous prognostic and predictive biomarkers to inform therapeutic decisions. Within this context, the management of lymph node-negative breast cancer is the subject of much debate with particular emphasis on the requirement for adjuvant chemotherapy. The identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers in this group of patients is crucial. Here, we demonstrate by tissue microarray and automated image analysis that the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is expressed in primary and metastatic breast cancer and is an independent poor prognostic factor in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, lymph node-negative tumors in two separate breast cancer cohorts (n=690; P=0.002, 0.013). We also show that CART increases the transcriptional activity of ERα in a ligand-independent manner via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and that CART stimulates an autocrine/paracrine loop within tumor cells to amplify the CART signal. Additionally, we demonstrate that CART expression in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines protects against tamoxifen-mediated cell death and that high CART expression predicts disease outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients in vivo in three independent breast cancer cohorts. We believe that CART profiling will help facilitate stratification of lymph node-negative breast cancer patients into high- and low-risk categories and allow for the personalization of therapy.

AB  - Knock-in mice with the common human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism have impaired trafficking of BDNF messenger RNA to dendrites. It was hypothesized, given evidence that local synapse formation is dependent on dendritic translation of BDNF messenger RNA, that loss-of-function Met allele mice would show synaptic deficits both at baseline and in response to ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that stimulates synaptogenesis in prefrontal cortex (PFC).

AB  - Abstract: Background: Stroke in crack–cocaine abusers is increasingly recognized. We aimed to identify significant differences in stroke risk factors, characteristics, and outcomes between hospitalized stroke patients with and without crack–cocaine abuse. Methods: This was a retrospective study that compared stroke patients with crack–cocaine abuse (cases) to stroke patients without crack–cocaine (controls). Results: We identified 93 crack–cocaine cases and 93 controls admitted between January 2004 and May 2006 to one teaching hospital. There were significant differences between crack–cocaine cases and controls in age (48.7 years vs. 55 years) (P = 0.0001), male gender (65.6% vs. 40.9%) (odds ratios, OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.22–2.21), arterial hypertension (61.1% vs. 83.9%) (OR = 0.30, 95% CI 0.15–0.60), hypercholesterolemia (18.7% vs. 68.5%) (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.05–0.21), diabetes (20.9% vs. 41.9%) (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.19–0.70), cigarette smoking (70.6% vs. 29%) (OR = 5.86, 95% CI 3.07–11.20), ischemic stroke (61.3% vs. 79.6%) (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.21–0.78), and intracerebral hemorrhage (33.3% vs. 17.2%) (OR = 3.03, 95% CI 1.53–6.00). Also, there were significant differences in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (3.3 vs. 7) (P < 0.0001), and MRS scores (1.8 vs. 2.5) (P = 0.0022) at hospital discharge. Using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, we found that crack–cocaine abusers had 2.28 higher odds of having a favorable functional outcome (MRS score ≤ 2) at hospital discharge, after adjusting for stroke risk factors and characteristics. Conclusions: Our study suggests that crack–cocaine abusers with stroke had fewer traditional risk factors, and more favorable functional outcome as compared to non-crack–cocaine abusers.

AB  - This study was aimed to examine the Attitudes-Social influence-Efficacy Model for the use of MDMA among college students in Taiwan. A representative sample of 3743 college students participated in this study. Each participant completed a comprehensive survey and 3090 valid data were collected. Correlation analyses displayed that either positive outcome expectancy or social influence was positively related to intention while refusal self-efficacy was negatively associated with intention. Using the Structural Equation Model, the results showed that the model fitted the data well. Intention for using MDMA affected MDMA use. Refusing self-efficacy significantly predicted intention and MDMA use indirectly via intention. Social influence had a direct impact on intention or MDMA use as well as an indirect effect on MDMA use via intention. However, positive outcome expectancy did not have an effect on both intention and the use of MDMA. Our results suggested that preventive programs in colleges for MDMA use should focus on developing strategies in decreasing the social influence and enhancing the refusal self-efficacy.

AB  - The use of cocaine causes cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Blockade of the cardiac potassium channel human ether-á-go-go-related gene (hERG) has been implicated as a mechanism for the proarrhythmic action of cocaine. hERG encodes the pore-forming subunits of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K(+) channel (I(Kr)), which is important for cardiac repolarization. Blockade of I(Kr)/hERG represents a common mechanism for drug-induced long QT syndrome. The mechanisms for many common drugs to block the hERG channel are not well understood. We investigated the molecular determinants of hERG channels in cocaine-hERG interactions using site-targeted mutations and patch-clamp method. Wild-type and mutant hERG channels were heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. We found that there was no correlation between inactivation gating and cocaine block of hERG channels. We also found that consistent with Thr-623, Tyr-652, and Phe-656 being critical for drug binding to hERG channels, mutations in these residues significantly reduced cocaine-induced block, and the hydrophobicity of the residues at position 656 dictated the cocaine sensitivity of the channel. Although the S620T mutation, which removed hERG inactivation, reduced cocaine block by 21-fold, the S620C mutation, which also completely removed hERG inactivation, did not affect the blocking potency of cocaine. Thus, Ser-620 is another pore helix residue whose mutation can interfere with cocaine binding independently of its effect on inactivation.

AB  - Objective: The completion of the human genome sequence has spurred investigation of the genetic contribution to substance dependence. In this article some of the recent scientific evidence for genetic determinants of opioid and cocaine dependence is reviewed. Method: An electronic search of the medical literature was conducted to locate published studies relevant to the genetics of opioid and cocaine dependence. The collected information judged to be most pertinent is described and discussed. Results: Genetic epidemiologic studies support a high degree of heritable vulnerability for both opioid and cocaine dependence. Polymorphisms in the genes coding for dopamine receptors and transporter, opioid receptors, endogenous opioid peptides, cannabinoid receptors, and serotonin receptors and transporter all appear to be associated with the phenotypic expression of this vulnerability once opioids or cocaine are consumed. Conclusions: Despite this initial progress, identification of specific genes and quantification of associated risk for the expression of each gene remain to be elucidated. While alteration of an individual's genome to change the phenotype seems remote, future interventions for treatment of opioid and cocaine dependence may include precise medications targeted to block the effects of proteins that have been identified through genetic research.

AB  - This paper examines the use of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) among a sample of gay men in New York City, who identify GHB as their most frequently used club drug. The sample was drawn from a larger longitudinal investigation of club drug using men. Thematic analysis yielded findings regarding perceived stigma for GHB use, tolerance of potential adverse side effects, and reasons for why some prefer this substance to other club drugs. Specifically, our findings suggest that GHB is viewed unfavorably in many social circles, that side effects are tolerated by frequent GHB users, and that the drug is chosen over other substances because the short duration of action, energy boost, sleep assistance, increase in libido, and limited after-effects. Examining the reasons why men use this substance will lead to the development of GHB specific prevention strategies, which accurately address the consequences of use as well as the motivations that individuals possess for using the substance.

AB  - RationaleDrug abuse can be characterized as a condition in which the choice to self-administer a drug is excessive, even exclusive of the choice of other reinforcers. Under concurrent interval schedules of reinforcement, subjects typically distribute behavior to match reinforcement allocation. However, research has shown that when behavior is maintained by different doses of cocaine under concurrent variable-interval (conc VI) schedules, exclusive choice of the higher dose is the rule.ObjectiveThe present study was designed to examine the generality of this finding to other behavioral conditions.MethodsRhesus monkeys ( n=5) lever pressed under a conc VI 60-s VI 60-s or a conc VI 600-s VI 600-s schedule of cocaine (i.v.) presentation. Doses differing by 4-fold (0.025 versus 0.1, 0.05 versus 0.2 mg/kg per injection) were available for lever pressing.ResultsMonkeys responded more on the lever associated with the higher dose when saline or a lower dose was the alternative. The distribution of responses was well predicted by relative drug intake, but with consistent undermatching. Exclusive high-dose responding was seen in about half of the individual session intervals under the shorter schedule, rarely under the longer schedule, and was not seen over the session.ConclusionUnder conc VI schedules, behavior was apportioned between two different doses in a manner that favored the higher dose but undermatched relative intake. Exclusive high-dose choice may occur when cocaine is frequently available but is not an invariable outcome of the choice between a low and a high dose of cocaine.

AB  - Abstract: The literature on drug-using gay men has documented a strong relationship between methamphetamine (MA) use and high-risk sexual practices. Of particular concern is that MA use is associated with powerful sexual effects that may facilitate the transmission of HIV. As a group, Latino gay men show high risk for HIV infection, and such risk has been related to episodes of sex under the influence of drugs. However, little information exists about stimulant use among Latino gay men, and it is not known whether MA use in this population is similarly motivated by sexual effects. This study reports reasons for stimulant use in a sample of 300 Latino gay men randomly selected from social and sexual venues; only men who reported stimulant use in the last 6 months were included in the study. Of stimulant users, 51% (n=153) reported MA, 44% (n=133) reported cocaine, and 5% (n=14) reported crack as their “most frequently used stimulant” (MFS); reasons for use were assessed for the participant’s specific MFS. Reasons for stimulant use clustered by five main factors, including energy, sexual enhancement, social connection, coping with stressors, and focused work productivity. MA users gave reasons more frequently related to sexual enhancement (to have better sex, more sex, and more anal sex) whereas cocaine users gave reasons more often related to social connections (to be more sociable and to fit in with other gay men). These findings suggest that Latino gay men use stimulants for reasons that are important in their social, emotional, work, and sexual lives. Like non-Latino Whites, Latino gay men were found to rely on MA for reasons related to sexual enhancement, possibly to meet cultural expectations and norms of sexual prowess and sexual success in the gay community.

AB  - The Val66Met polymorphism in the brain‐derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) gene results in alterations in fear extinction behavior in both human populations and mouse models. However, it is not clear whether this polymorphism plays a similar role in extinction of appetitive behaviors. Therefore, we examined operant learning and extinction of both food and cocaine self‐administration behavior in an inbred genetic knock‐in mouse strain expressing the variant Bdnf. These mice provide a unique opportunity to relate alterations in aversive and appetitive extinction learning as well as provide insight into how human genetic variation can lead to differences in behavior. BDNFMet/Metmice exhibited a severe deficit in operant learning as demonstrated by an inability to learn the food self‐administration task. Therefore, extinction experiments were performed comparing wildtype (BDNFVal/Val) animals to mice heterozygous for the Met allele (BDNFVal/Met), which did not differ in food or cocaine self‐administration behavior. In contrast to the deficit in fear extinction previously demonstrated in these mice, we found that BDNFVal/Metmice exhibited more rapid extinction of cocaine responding compared to wildtype mice. No differences were found between the genotypes in the extinction of food self‐administration behavior or the reinstatement of cocaine seeking, indicating that the effect is specific to extinction of cocaine responding. These results suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying aversive and appetitive extinction are distinct from one another and BDNF may play opposing roles in the two phenomena.

AB  - Cocaine‐induced neuroadaptation of stress‐related circuitry and increased access to cocaine each putatively contribute to the transition from cocaine use to cocaine dependence. The present study tested the hypothesis that rats receiving extended versus brief daily access to cocaine would exhibit regional differences in levels of the stress‐regulatory neuropeptide corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF). A secondary goal was to explore how CRF levels change in relation to the time since cocaine self‐administration. Male Wistar rats acquired operant self‐administration of cocaine and were assigned to receive daily long access (6 hours/day, LgA, n= 20) or short access (1 hour/day, ShA, n= 18) to intravenous cocaine self‐administration (fixed ratio 1, ∼0.50 mg/kg/infusion). After at least 3 weeks, tissue CRF immunoreactivity was measured at one of three timepoints: pre‐session, post‐session or 3 hours post‐session. LgA, but not ShA, rats showed increased total session and first‐hour cocaine intake. CRF immunoreactivity increased within the dorsal raphe (DR) and basolateral, but not central, nucleus of the amygdala (BLA, CeA) of ShA rats from pre‐session to 3 hours post‐session. In LgA rats, CRF immunoreactivity increased from pre‐session to 3 hours post‐session within the CeA and DR but tended to decrease in the BLA. LgA rats showed higher CRF levels than ShA rats in the DR and, pre‐session, in the BLA. Thus, voluntary cocaine intake engages stress‐regulatory CRF systems of the DR and amygdala. Increased availability of cocaine promotes greater tissue CRF levels in these extrahypothalamic brain regions, changes associated here with a model of cocaine dependence.

AB  - The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is an important regulator of the stress response and mediates several stress-related behaviors, including anxiety. Despite anatomical evidence that eCBs interact with the principle stress peptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), few data exist that address functional interactions between these systems. Accordingly, we examined the effects of the CB1 receptor antagonist, AM251, on behavioral anxiety induced by (1) exogenous CRF, and (2) withdrawal from chronic cocaine exposure (mediated by CRF). After behavioral testing, we collected blood and assessed plasma corticosterone levels. In Experiment 1, male Long-Evans rats were pretreated with AM251 (0, 10, 100, or 200 μg, i.c.v.), followed by CRF (0 or 0.5 μg, i.c.v.), before testing for anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM). In Experiment 2, rats were exposed to cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline for 14 consecutive days. Forty-eight hours following cocaine exposure, rats were pretreated with AM251 (0, 10, or 100 μg, i.c.v.) and tested in the EPM. AM251 produced an anxiogenic response at the highest dose, but reversed the behavioral anxiety induced by CRF and withdrawal from chronic cocaine in a dose-dependent manner. AM251 also increased plasma corticosterone levels, but did so irrespective of CRF treatment or cocaine preexposure. Our findings suggest that the anxiogenic effects of CRF and cocaine withdrawal are mediated, at least in part, by CB1 receptor transmission, and provide evidence in support of eCB-CRF interactions that are independent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

AB  - Abstract: Rationale: Enhanced sensitivity to the euphoric and locomotor-activating effects of psychostimulants may influence an individual's predisposition to drug abuse and addiction. While drug-induced behaviors are mediated by the actions of several neurotransmitter systems, past research revealed that the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system is important in driving the acute locomotor response to psychostimulants. Objectives: We previously reported that genetic deletion of the CRF type-2 receptor (CRF-R2), but not the CRF type-1 receptor (CRF-R1) dampened the acute locomotor stimulant response to methamphetamine (1 mg/kg). These results contrasted with previous studies implicating CRF-R1 in the locomotor effects of psychostimulants. Since the majority of previous studies focused on cocaine, rather than methamphetamine, we set out to test the hypothesis that these drugs differentially engage CRF-R1 and CRF-R2. Methods: We expanded our earlier findings by first replicating our previous experiments at a higher dose of methamphetamine (2 mg/kg), and by assessing the effects of the CRF-R1-selective antagonist CP-376,395 (10 mg/kg) on methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity. Next, we used both genetic and pharmacological tools to examine the specific components of the CRF system underlying the acute locomotor response to cocaine (5–10 mg/kg). Results: While genetic deletion of CRF-R2 dampened the locomotor response to methamphetamine (but not cocaine), genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of CRF-R1 dampened the locomotor response to cocaine (but not methamphetamine). Conclusions: These findings highlight the differential involvement of CRF receptors in acute sensitivity to two different stimulant drugs of abuse, providing an intriguing basis for the development of more targeted therapeutics for psychostimulant addiction.

AB  - Significant sex differences have been demonstrated in clinical and preclinical studies of cocaine addiction, with some of the most consistent differences noted in regard to the role of stress and craving. The current study examined stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking in male and female rats in an animal model of relapse using corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) administration. Both male and female rats demonstrated increased cocaine seeking in response to CRF. CRF-induced reinstatement was highly variable across both male and female rats, and further analysis revealed a subpopulation that was particularly sensitive to CRF (high responders). Female high responders displayed significantly increased responding to CRF compared to males. Individual differences in stress responsivity could thus contribute to the likelihood of relapse, with females showing greater heterogeneity to stress-induced relapse.

AB  - We demonstrated that the genotype of the variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) in the linked polymorphic region (LPR) of the 5′ promoter and in the intron 2 (Stin2) transcriptional regulatory domains of the serotonin transporter SLC6A4gene determined its promoter interactions with transcription factors and co‐activators in response to cocaine in the JAr cell line. The LPR variants contain 14 (short, s) or 16 (long, l) copies of a 22–23 bp repeat element, whereas the Stin2 VNTR exists as three variants containing 9, 10 or 12 copies of a 16–17 bp repeat. We observed a differential effect of cocaine on the association of the promoter with the transcription factor CTCF, which bound to both LPR alleles prior to cocaine exposure but only to the l‐allele following exposure. Significantly, this differential effect of cocaine was correlated with the binding of the transcriptional regulator MeCP2 specifically to the s‐allele and recruiting the histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). Concurrently, cocaine increased the association of positive histone marks over the SLC6A4gene locus. At the Stin2 domain, we lost binding of the transcription factor YB‐1, while CTCF remained bound. Our biochemical data are consistent with differential reporter gene activity directed by the individual or dual domains in response to cocaine in an Epstein–Barr virus‐based episome model of stable transfections. These observations suggest that exposure of JAr cells to cocaine may result in differential binding of transcription factors and activators based on a specific genotype that might alter epigenetic parameters affecting gene expression after the initial challenge.

AB  - Cocaine‐induced effects at specific BDNF promoters are mediated by distinct epigenetic mechanisms.  The molecular mechanisms that regulate time‐dependent changes in VTA BDNF protein expression during drug abstinence are not clear. Here, we show for the first time that VTA BDNF mRNA, specifically exon I‐containing transcript, is increased following 7 days of drug abstinence and that distinct epigenetic mechanisms regulate BDNF gene transcription. These results indicate that targeting specific epigenetic mechanisms that regulate VTA BDNF expression during drug abstinence may prevent cocaine craving and relapse.

AB  - Distinct forms of MEF2 transcription factor act as positive or negative regulators of dendritic spine formation, with MEF2C playing a key regulator role in synapse plasticity. We report here that acute cocaine treatment of rats induced the expression of MEF2C in the striatum through a recently discovered transduction pathway. Repeated injections were found to induce MEF2C to a lesser extent. The mechanism by which MEF2C was induced involves the subsequent activation of the salt‐inducible kinase SIK1 and the phosphorylation of HDAC5, a member of the class IIa of HDACs. Cocaine activated SIK1 by phosphorylation on Thr‐182 residue, which was accompanied by the nuclear import of the kinase. In the nuclear compartment, SIK1 then phosphorylated HDAC5 causing the shuttling of its phospho‐form from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of striatal cells. Activation of SIK1 by cocaine was further validated by the phosphorylation of TORC1/3, which was followed by the shuttling of TORC proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Activation of MEF2C was assessed by measuring the expression of the MEF2Cgene itself, since the gene is known to be under the control of its own product. Since MEF2C plays a key role in memory/learning processes, activation of this pathway by cocaine is probably involved in plasticity mechanisms whereby the drug establishes its long‐term effects such as drug dependence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:: The serum activity of the hepatic enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is elevated in the newborn relative to older age groups. Few reports to date have studied the influence of perinatal factors on neonatal serum GGT and no study has assessed the influence of maternal drug ingestion. STUDY DESIGN:: Cord blood was randomly collected from 234 liveborn infants and correlated with a range of maternal and fetal perinatal variables to assess influences on cord blood GGT. RESULTS:: Our study showed that the range of cord blood GGT activity in 234 randomly selected term newborns was 22 to 556 IU/l. In a subgroup of 75 newborns, GGT activity was independently influenced by only two of the variables studied — cocaine exposure and fetal gender (p=0.009, r=0.39). Females had a lower GGT than males (95±66 vs 130±90 IU/l, p<0.001) while GGT activity in cocaine-exposed newborns was lower than in cocaine-nonexposed newborns (96±48 vs 142±109, p<0.01). Birth weight, race, gestational age, and maternal serum GGT were not found to significantly influence cord blood GGT activity. Maternal GGT was uniformly normal and was not affected by any of the variables tested. CONCLUSION:: Our findings demonstrate that the reference range for cord blood GGT activity is wide and appears to be influenced by fetal gender and cocaine exposure.

AB  - We investigated the pharmacokinetic determinants of the frequency of intravenous cocaine self-administration in 2.5-h sessions. Two groups of rats were implanted with dual catheters that permitted cocaine infusion and blood sampling via the femoral and jugular vein catheters, respectively. Half of the animals in each group self-administered one of the two cocaine unit doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg/infusion) by pressing a lever under a continuous schedule of reinforcement. To monitor serum cocaine concentrations, the remaining animals received concurrent, response-independent infusions whenever the matched animals self-administered cocaine infusions. Multiple concentration-time data in two successive self-administrations were determined to monitor the extent of fluctuation in concentrations by pharmacokinetic modeling. Behavioral analyses revealed the higher unit dose (1 mg/kg) resulted in less frequent cocaine self-administration, and a longer interinfusion interval, whereas the total doses were similar for the two groups (24.5-27.0 mg/kg/2.5 h). Cocaine decayed biexponentially. Both the values of clearance and terminal elimination rate constant for the self-administration paradigm were significantly greater than those after the bolus cocaine dosing series (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, separated by 3 days). The regularity in cocaine self-administration produced relatively stable serum cocaine concentrations that oscillated between maximum (C(max)) and minimum (C(min)) values regardless of dose size and interinfusion interval. Although the C(max) for the 1-mg/kg unit dose (1.47 microg/ml) was significantly higher than that for the 0.5-mg/kg dose (0.82 microg/ml), the C(min) values between the groups approximated each other (0.28, and 0.34 microg/ml, respectively). Hence, the C(min) is the determinant of the initiation of the next drug-taking behavior.

AB  - Factors that contributed to long‐term recovery from cocaine dependence were examined as part of a 5‐year national follow‐up study of 708 patients from 45 treatment programs in eight U.S. cities. Outcomes from 33% of the sample were highly favorable at follow‐up, including no drugs detected in urine or hair specimens, no self‐reported use of any drugs, less than daily alcohol use, and no illegal activity or arrests during the past year. Major reasons cited for these improvements were motivations to change, positive influences of family, strength from religion and spirituality, and help from drug treatment. “Recovery” was viewed as a continuous process and one that benefits from lessons learned in treatment. These retrospective attributions affirm many of the same findings from prospective outcome studies and contribute to a conceptual framework for treatment process and recovery.

AB  - The present study assessed the factor structure, reliability, test retest, convergent validity, and predictive validity of the Obsessive Compulsive Cocaine Scale (OCCS), a newly developed questionnaire adapted from the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). The questionnaire was administered to 189 cocaine-dependent individuals participating in two medication treatment trials for cocaine dependence. Confirmatory factor analysis of this measure revealed that it primarily assesses two factors, obsessions and compulsions. In addition, the data provided strong support for the internal consistency, test–retest reliability, predictive validity, and convergent validity of this two-factor measure. Overall, the data provide support for the psychometric strength of a modified version of the OCDS specifically designed to assess obsessive and compulsive cocaine use among those with cocaine dependence.

AB  - Cocaine dependence is associated with high relapse rates, but few biological markers associated with relapse outcomes have been identified. Extending preclinical research showing a role for central brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in cocaine seeking, we examined whether serum BDNF is altered in abstinent, early recovering, cocaine-dependent individuals and whether it is predictive of subsequent relapse risk.

AB  - Several studies suggest that hypothalamic cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) may interact with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the control of neuroendocrine function and may also participate in cardiovascular regulation. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate, in experimental models of isotonic (I-EVE) and hypertonic (H-EVE) extracellular volume expansion and water deprivation (WD), the activation of CART- and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF)-immunoreactive neurons, as well as the relative expression of CART and CRF mRNAs in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei of the hypothalamus. Both H-EVE (0.30M NaCl, 2mL/100g of body weight, in 1 minute) and 24 hours of WD significantly increased plasma sodium concentrations, producing, respectively, either an increase or a decrease in extracellular volume. I-EVE (0.15M NaCl, 2mL/100g of body weight, in 1 minute) evoked a significant increase in the circulating volume accompanied by unaltered plasma concentrations of sodium. CART-expressing neurons of both magnocellular and parvocellular hypothalamic divisions were activated to produce Fos in response to H-EVE but not in response to I-EVE. Furthermore, increased expression of CART mRNA was found in the PVN of H-EVE but not I-EVE rats. These data show for the first time that EVE not only activates hypothalamic CRF neurons but also increases CRF mRNA expression in the PVN. In contrast, WD increases the number of CART-immunoreactive neurons activated to produce Fos in the PVN and SON but does not change the number of neurons double labeled for Fos and CRF or expression of CRF mRNA in the PVN. These findings provided new insights into the participation of CART in diverse processes within the PVN and SON, including its possible involvement in activation of the HPA axis and cardiovascular regulation in response to changes in extracellular volume and osmolality.

AB  - Evidence suggests that the noradrenergic and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) systems play critical roles in relapse and stress-related behaviors. In particular, behavioral studies point to a serial signaling process initiated by β-adrenergic receptors that requires CRF receptor (CRFR)-dependent signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to produce stress-induced relapse to cocaine seeking.

AB  - Suicide, as the 11th leading cause of death in America, is a significant public health concern. Previous studies have shown that drug users are a population at especially high risk for suicidal ideation (SI). Although most people who think about killing themselves do not ultimately commit suicide, identifying those at risk for such thoughts is important.

AB  - Abstract: Rationale: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist which interferes with the action of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) including glutamate and aspartate. The use of ketamine at subanaesthetic doses has increased because of its psychotomimetic properties. However, long-term ketamine abuse may interfere with memory processes and inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, an effect probably mediated by its NMDA antagonist action. Neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) serve as survival factors for selected populations of central nervous system neurons, including cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons. In addition, neurotrophins, particularly BDNF, may regulate LTP in the hippocampus and influence synaptic plasticity. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that ketamine use in humans is associated with altered serum levels of neurotrophins. Methods: We measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the NGF and BDNF serum levels in two groups of subjects: frequent ketamine users and healthy subjects. Results: Our data show that BDNF serum levels were increased in chronic ketamine users as compared to healthy subjects, while NGF levels were not affected by ketamine use. Conclusion: These findings suggest that chronic ketamine intake is associated with increases in BDNF serum levels in humans. Other studies are needed to explore the pharmacological and molecular mechanism by which ketamine, and/or other NMDA antagonists, may induce modification in the production and utilization of BDNF and alter normal brain function.

AB  - This study examined ecstasy use and associated risk and protective factors among Asian American youth. Data from 996 Asian American adolescents and 1,108 Asian American young adults were used. Ecstasy use was relatively common among Asian American youth. Among adolescents, it was associated with older age, poor parent-child communication, having been approached by drug sellers, living in a metropolitan area, and positive attitudes toward substance use. Among Asian American young adults, it was associated with having been born in the United States, having been approached by drug sellers, criminal justice system involvement, and positive attitudes toward substance use. Implications for designing substance use prevention/intervention programs for this minority group are discussed.

AB  - Abstract. Rationale: Although the behavioral, subjective, and physiological effects of oral cocaine have been investigated, its reinforcing effects have not been demonstrated. Objective: The primary aims of this study were to examine the reinforcing effects of oral cocaine and determine whether such effects can be influenced by manipulating behavioral requirements following drug ingestion. Methods: Nine adult volunteers with histories of cocaine abuse were trained to discriminate between orally administered cocaine (100 mg/70 kg) and placebo capsules under double-blind conditions. Following acquisition of cocaine vs placebo discrimination (80% correct), the reinforcing effects of cocaine were determined using two different choice conditions (dependent and independent). Volunteers were first exposed to cocaine and placebo once each with a relaxation activity (sitting in a cushioned chair) and a vigilance activity (performing a computer task). Following exposure to each drug with each activity, volunteers began the dependent choice condition. Every 2 days volunteers chose which drug (cocaine or placebo) they ingested with the vigilance and relaxation activities. Volunteers could not choose the same drug with both activities. This procedure occurred 5 times over a 10-day period. The independent choice condition took place over 2 days. On one day, volunteers chose which drug (cocaine or placebo) they ingested with the relaxation activity and, on the other day (in counterbalanced order), which drug they ingested with the vigilance activity. Volunteers were allowed to select the same drug with both activities. Results: All volunteers successfully acquired the cocaine vs placebo discrimination. In the dependent choice condition, all volunteers significantly chose cocaine over placebo with the vigilance activity and chose placebo over cocaine with the relaxation activity. In the independent choice condition, volunteers significantly chose cocaine over placebo with the vigilance activity (i.e., cocaine functioned as a positive reinforcer in the vigilance context). Interestingly, the independent choice condition also showed that volunteers chose placebo over cocaine with the relaxation activity (i.e., cocaine functioned as a negative reinforcer because it was avoided relative to placebo). Conclusion: The study shows that the behavioral requirements following drug ingestion can be a determinant of whether or not oral cocaine functions as a reinforcer in volunteers with histories of cocaine abuse.

AB  - This paper presents findings from an elicitation study that focused on the sexual risks and condom use behaviour of African American crack smokers. Of interest were the attitudes, beliefs, and barriers that affect the adoption and maintenance of condoms as an HIV prophylactic. Thick descriptive data were collected from 64 heterosexual African Americans who smoke crack cocaine. Data were content analysed for descriptions of condom use attitudes, normative beliefs, and barriers or facilitators of condom use. Participants described few positive condom use outcome expectations, while detailing several negative expectations. Normative beliefs were found to be weakly related to condom use with casual partners. However, descriptions of sexual relationships with intimate partners indicated that the normative expectations of the partner strongly influenced condom use. Participants described few contextual barriers to condom use, although situational barriers, including crack addiction, were identified.

AB  - Studies of Alzheimer's disease patients show that individuals with larger premorbid brains have a later onset of disease, or a lessened severity of cognitive impairment, or both. This may be due to a functional reserve associated with the greater number of neurons and synapses available in larger brains. We used magnetic resonance imaging and the MicroCog Assessment of Cognitive Functioning to examine the association between intracranial volume (premorbid brain size) and neuropsychological function in abstinent crack-cocaine and crack-cocainealcohol dependent individuals. There were no significant differences between the crack-only and the crackalcohol dependent participants in neuropsychological performance or in intracranial volume. The abstinent cocaine-dependent individuals (both crack-only and crackalcohol) were significantly impaired in many neuropsychological domains. Intracranial volume accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in neuropsychological performance. This result is consistent with the finding in the Alzheimer's literature that larger brains can maintain function to a greater degree, or for a longer period of time, in the face of cerebral disease or insult. Functional reserve may be a heretofore little recognized protective mechanism of the brain that has consequences for the severity of expression of cerebral disease or insult throughout life.

AB  - Neuroinflammation associated with advanced HIV-1 infection is often exacerbated in cocaine-abusing, HIV-infected patients. The underlying mechanisms could, in part, be attributed to the increased impairment of blood brain barrier integrity in the presence of cocaine. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been implicated in several pathologic conditions, specifically attributable to its potent mitogenic effects. Its modulation by drug abuse, however, has received very little attention. In the present study, we demonstrated cocaine-mediated induction of PDGF-BB in human brain microvascular endothelial cells through the binding to its cognate σ receptor. Furthermore, this effect was mediated, with subsequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Egr-1 pathways, culminating ultimately into increased expression of PDGF-BB. Cocaine exposure resulted in increased permeability of the endothelial barrier, and this effect was abrogated in mice exposed to PDGF-BB neutralizing antibody, thus underscoring its role as a vascular permeant. In vivo relevance of these findings was further corroborated in cocaine-treated mice that were administered neutralizing antibody specific for PDGF-BB as well as in Egr-1−/−mice. Understanding the regulation of PDGF-BB expression may provide insights into the development of potential therapeutic targets for neuroinflammation associated with HIV infection and drug abuse.

AB  - Background: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; “Ecstasy”) is an amphetamine derivative with mild hallucinogenic and stimulant qualities. MDMA leads to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) neurotoxicity and has been linked to cognitive impairments. It remains unclear whether these impairments are due to MDMA versus other drug use. Method: Neurocognitive functioning was measured in a sample of abstinent polydrug users (n = 52) with a range of MDMA use and healthy nondrug controls (n = 29). Participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and self-report measures of drug use. Results: Polydrug users performed worse than controls on spatial span and spatial working memory (ps < .05). Among polydrug users, lifetime marijuana use significantly predicted verbal learning and memory performance (p < .01), while MDMA use was not predictive of cognitive impairment. Conclusions: This study and our previous report (Hanson, Luciana, & Sullwold, 2008) suggest that moderate MDMA use does not lead to persistent impairments above and beyond that associated with generally heavy drug use, but polydrug use may lead to dose-related temporal and frontoparietal dysfunction. Marijuana use may be particularly problematic. Cause-effect relations are unclear.

AB  - Abstract: Objective: This paper examines the prevalence of and the factors associated with condom use in a sample of 283 young adult ecstasy users.Methods: The study, which relied upon targeted sampling and ethnographic mapping, took place between 2002 and 2004. It entailed conducting two-hour-long, face-to-face interviews in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. Results: Condom use was inconsistent; only 35.2% of all sex acts were protected. Using multiple regression, five factors were related to condom use: race (Caucasians used condoms less than other groups), income (lower income = greater condom use), relationship status (persons involved in relationships reported less condom use than those who were not “involved”), multiple sex partners (multiple sex partners = more condom use), and condom use self-efficacy (higher efficacy level = more condom use). Conclusions: Condom use rates were not optimal in this population. In particular, targeted interventions are needed for Caucasian ecstasy users. Intervention efforts ought to address relationship (in)fidelity as it pertains to engaging in safer sex practices, especially among persons involved in relationships. Intervention efforts also need to work to increase condom use self-efficacy.

AB  - The present study was aimed to explore the correlation between the protein structure and catalytic efficiency of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) mutants against (−)-cocaine by modeling the rate-determining transition state (TS1), i.e., the transition state for the first step of chemical reaction process, of (−)-cocaine hydrolysis catalyzed by various mutants of human BChE in comparison with the wild type. Molecular modeling of the TS1 structures revealed that mutations on certain nonactive site residues can indirectly affect the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme against (−)-cocaine through enhancing or weakening the overall hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygen of (−)-cocaine benzoyl ester and the oxyanion hole of the enzyme. Computational insights and predictions were supported by the catalytic activity data obtained from wet experimental tests on the mutants of human BChE, including five new mutants reported for the first time. The BChE mutants with at least ∼1000-fold improved catalytic efficiency against (−)-cocaine compared to the wild-type BChE are all associated with the TS1 structures having stronger overall hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygen of (−)-cocaine benzoyl ester and the oxyanion hole of the enzyme. The combined computational and experimental data demonstrate a reasonable correlation relationship between the hydrogen-bonding distances in the TS1 structure and the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme against (−)-cocaine.

AB  - Aims:The aim of this article was to investigate the factors associated with ecstasy use in school-aged teenagers.Methods:This was a longitudinal study of adolescent drug use, which was undertaken in three towns in Northern Ireland. A questionnaire was administered annually to participants. In this article ecstasy use patterns amongst a cohort of young people aged 14–16 years participating in the Belfast Youth Development Study (BYDS) was explored.Findings:The percentage of those who had used ecstasy at least once increased from 7 when aged 14 years to 9 at 15 and 13 at 16 years. Female gender, delinquency, problem behaviours at school and the number of evenings spent out with friends each week were found to be significant variables predicting ‘ever use’ of ecstasy in all 3 years by logistic regression.Conclusions:The findings suggest that ecstasy use patterns may be changing from their historical perception as a ‘party’ drug, as the demographic profile ecstasy of users in this study reflected the traditional profile of illicit drug use during adolescence, which raises challenges for addressing the problems associated with this drug.

AB  - Rats with extended daily cocaine access show escalating cocaine self-administration and behavioral signs of dependence. Regulation of glutamatergic transmission by metabotropic glutamate receptors has emerged as a mechanism in the addictive actions of drugs of abuse. We examined here whether neuroadaptive dysregulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor function is a factor in escalating cocaine self-administration.

AB  - The non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine has been shown to produce cognitive deficits. However, the effects of ketamine on the consolidation phase of memory remain poorly characterized. Here we show that systemic administration of ketamine immediately after training dose-dependently impairs long-term retention of memory for a novel object recognition (NOR) task in rats. Control experiments showed that the impairing effects of ketamine could not be attributed to an influence on memory retrieval or sensorimotor effects. In addition, ketamine prevented the increase in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels induced by NOR learning. Our results show for the first time that ketamine disrupts the consolidation phase of long-term recognition memory. In addition, the findings suggest that the amnestic effects of ketamine might be at least partially mediated by an influence on BDNF signaling in the hippocampus.

AB  - MDMA is an illegal drug widely used by young people. The present study aimed to determine the involvement of different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes in the suppressive effect of MDMA in TNF-α production. Dihydrobetaerythroidine (antagonist of heteromeric nAChR), and hexamethonium (antagonist of peripheral nAChR), fully antagonized the effect of MDMA. Conversely, methyllycaconitine (antagonist of homomeric nAChR), did not modify it. From in vitroexperiments, a direct effect was ruled out. In this study we provide the first evidence that in rodents MDMA impairs the production of TNF-α by activation of heteromeric nAChR expressing beta-2 subunits located in the periphery.

AB  - Introduction and Aims.Considerable concern has been raised about associations between ecstasy use and mental health. Studies of ecstasy users typically investigate varying levels of lifetime use of ecstasy, and often fail to account for other drug use and sociodemographic characteristics of participants, which may explain mixed findings. The current study aimed to examine the relationship between patterns of recent (last six months) ecstasy use and psychological distress among current, regular ecstasy users, controlling for sociodemographic risk factors and patterns of other drug use. Design and Methods.Data were collected from regular ecstasy users (n = 752) recruited from each capital city in Australia as part of the Ecstasy and related Drugs Reporting System (EDRS). Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Data were analysed using multinomial logistic regression. Results.Seven per cent of the sample scored in the ‘high’ distress category and 55% in the ‘medium’ distress category. Patterns of ecstasy use were not independently associated with psychological distress. The strongest predictors of distress were female sex, lower education, unemployment, ‘binge’ drug use including ecstasy (use for >48 h without sleep), frequent cannabis use and daily tobacco use. Discussion and Conclusions.Regular ecstasy users have elevated levels of psychological distress compared with the general population; however, ecstasy use per se was not independently related to such distress. Other factors, including sociodemographic characteristics and other drug use patterns, appear to be more important. These findings highlight the importance of targeting patterns of polydrug use in order to reduce drug‐related harm among regular ecstasy users.[George J, Kinner SA, Bruno R, Degenhardt L, Dunn M.

AB  - AbstractAims/Objectives:Methylenedioxymethamphetamine affects the central serotonergic system, and there is some evidence for an association between ecstasy use (drugs sold as methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of self-reported depression and associated help-seeking among a sample of regular ecstasy users. A further aim was to examine the correlates of depressive symptomatology in this population. Materials and Methods:100 regular ecstasy consumers (at least monthly use) were interviewed as part of the Ecstasy and Related Drug Reporting System in Tasmania, Australia. Participants were also administered epidemiological measures of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) and psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale). Results:One quarter (23) of participants self-reported recent experience of depression, a rate notably greater than the general population. However, only one third of these participants had attended a health professional for this issue. A range of drug use factors (e.g. frequency and quantity of ecstasy use, frequent cannabis or methamphetamine use, intravenous drug use, polydrug use, binge drug use, harmful alcohol use, and elevated psychological dependence scores for ecstasy and methamphetamine) were associated with high levels of depressive symptomatology. Conclusion:These findings are consistent with an association between depressive symptomatology and ecstasy and other drug use. Harm reduction strategies which target drug use factors such as those identified in this study may also aid in the reduction of the experience of depression. Considering the low levels of help-seeking among this population, improving awareness and access to information and treatment for depression may also be important.Copyright © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Objective: The University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA) is a widely used tool for measuring subjects’ readiness to change substance-using behaviors. The aim of this study was to examine the factor structure of the Chinese version of the URICA (C-URICA) in Taiwanese adolescents who have used methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or methamphetamine (MAMP). Methods: Pre-test and post-test data from the C-URICA from 92 adolescents in a juvenile abstinence center who had used MDMA or MAMP were analyzed. We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the adequacy of the factor structure of the C-URICA. Results: CFA indicated that a three-factor structure (pre-contemplation, contemplation action, maintenance) had a better goodness of fit than four-factor (pre-contemplation, contemplation, action, maintenance), and one-factor structures. Conclusions: The results indicated that the URICA may have different factor structures when used in the population different from the original adult population with alcohol drinking.

AB  - Corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) in the amygdala is involved in stress responses. Moreover, dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain reward system including the amygdala plays a significant role in the pathology of cocaine addiction. The present study analysed CRF‐induced synaptic plasticity, its pharmacological sensitivity and interactions with the dopamine (DA) system in the basolateral to lateral capsula central amygdala (lcCeA) pathway after a 2‐week withdrawal from repeated cocaine administration. A physiologically relevant CRF concentration (25 nm) induced long‐term potentiation (LTP) that was enhanced after cocaine withdrawal. In saline‐treated rats, CRF‐induced LTP was mediated through N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, L‐type voltage‐gated calcium channels (L‐VGCCs) and CRF1receptors. However, in cocaine‐withdrawn animals, activation of CRF1and CRF2receptors was found to enhance LTP. This enhanced CRF‐induced LTP after cocaine withdrawal was mediated through endogenous activation of both D1‐ and D2‐like receptors. Furthermore, expression of the D1 receptor (D1R) but not the D2R, D3R, D4R or D5R was significantly increased after cocaine withdrawal. CRF1but not CRF2protein expression was increased, suggesting that elevated levels of these proteins contributed to the enhancement of CRF‐induced LTP during cocaine withdrawal. CRF interactions with the DA system in the amygdala may represent a fundamental neurochemical and cellular mechanism linking stress to cocaine‐induced neuronal plasticity.

AB  - Risk perception, perceived behavioral control of obtaining ecstasy (PBC-obtaining), current ecstasy dependence, and recent depression have been associated with past ecstasy use, however, their utility in predicting ecstasy use has not been demonstrated. This study aimed to determine whether these four modifiable risk factors could predict ecstasy use after controlling for socio-demographic covariates and recent polydrug use. Data from 601 ecstasy users in the National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded TriCity Study of Club Drug Use, Abuse and Dependence were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Participants were interviewed twice within a 2-week period using standardized instruments. Thirteen percent (n=80) of the participants reported using ecstasy between the two interviews. Low risk perception, high PBC-obtaining (an estimated ecstasy procurement time <24h), and current ecstasy dependence were statistically associated with ecstasy use between the two interviews. Recent depression was not a significant predictor. Despite not being a target predictor, recent polydrug use was also statistically associated with ecstasy use. The present findings may inform the development of interventions targeting ecstasy users.

AB  - Cocaine exhibits high liability for inducing addictive behaviors, but the mechanisms of neuroplasticity underlying the behavioral effects remain unclear. As a crucial mediator of neuroplasticity in diverse functional models, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could contribute to the mechanisms of addiction-related neuroplasticity. Here, we addressed the hypothesis that cocaine increases synaptic dopamine, which induces BDNF protein expression to initiate addiction-related behavior in the rat. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure BDNF protein expression in rat striatal tissues. For behavioral readout, we used a noninvasive measurement system to measure the emission of 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalization (USV), a response that correlates with electrical brain stimulation and conditioned place preference behavior in rodents. A single injection of cocaine significantly increased BDNF protein expression, but this effect was not further augmented by repeated cocaine administration. A single administration of cocaine elicited significant and dose-related USV responses, and the magnitude of the behavior increased with repeated drug administration. R-(+)-7-Chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (SCH23390), but not raclopride, significantly attenuated cocaine-induced BDNF protein expression, whereas either the D(1)-like or D(2)-like receptor antagonist blocked cocaine-induced USV behavior. Furthermore, significant USV behavior was elicited by the nonselective dopamine agonist, apomorphine, but not by agonists that are selective for D(1)-like or D(2)-like receptors. Intracerebroventricular injection of the neurotrophin TrkB receptor inhibitor, K252a, blocked cocaine-induced USV behavior but not locomotor activity. These results suggest that neurotrophin signaling downstream of dopamine receptor function probably constitutes a crucial link in cocaine induction of USV behavior and may contribute to the mechanisms underlying the development of addiction-related behaviors.

AB  - The effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on cocaine-seeking are brain region-specific. Infusion of BDNF into subcortical structures, like the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area, enhances cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization and cocaine-seeking. Conversely, repeated administration of BDNF antiserum into the nucleus accumbens during chronic cocaine self-administration attenuates cocaine-induced reinstatement. In contrast, BDNF infusion into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex immediately following a final session of cocaine self-administration attenuates relapse to cocaine-seeking after abstinence, as well as cue- and cocaine prime-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking following extinction. BDNF-induced alterations in the ERK–MAP kinase cascade and in prefronto-accumbens glutamatergic transmission are implicated in BDNF's ability to alter cocaine-seeking. Within 22 hours after infusion into the prefrontal cortex, BDNF increases BDNF protein in prefrontal cortical targets, including nucleus accumbens, and restores cocaine-mediated decreases in phospho-ERK expression in the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, 3 weeks after BDNF infusion in animals with a cocaine self-administration history, suppressed basal levels of glutamate are normalized and a cocaine prime-induced increase in extracellular glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens is prevented. Thus, BDNF may have local effects at the site of infusion and distal effects in target areas that are critical to mediating or preventing cocaine-induced dysfunctional neuroadaptations.

AB  - Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), one of the major effectors of stress, plays a major role in the natural course of drug addiction by accelerating the acquisition of psychostimulant self-administration and increasing incentive motivation for the drug itself and for drug-associated stimuli. Stress-induced CRF is also considered a predictor of relapse and is responsible for feelings of anxiety and distress during cocaine withdrawal. Despite this knowledge, the role of CRF has not been explored in the context of recent research on reward-related learning, built on the hypothesis that neuroplastic changes in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry underlie addiction. The present review explores the effects of stress on the pattern of interaction between CRF, dopamine and glutamate in distinct structures of the mesocorticolimbic circuitry, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), amygdala, bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), after acute and chronic cocaine consumption as well as in early withdrawal and protracted abstinence. A better knowledge of the neurochemical and cellular mechanisms involved in these interactions would be useful to elucidate the role of CRF in cocaine-induced neuronal plasticity, which could be useful in developing new pharmacological strategies for the treatment of cocaine addiction.

AB  - Chronic cocaine induces high expression of the brain-specific Neural-Zinc-Finger transcription factor-2b (NZF-2b/7ZFMyt1), particularly in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, resulting in a 11-fold increase in NZF-2b/7ZFMyt1 expression in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc). Overexpression of this gene in the NAc with a NZF-2b/7ZFMyt1-expressing lentivirus resulted in >55% decrease in locomotor activity upon chronic cocaine administration, compared to control animals. In contrast knocking-down the gene in the NAc with lentiviruses expressing shRNAs against NZF-2b/7ZFMyt1 induced strong hyperlocomotor activity upon cocaine. Strong inhibition of BDNF is observed upon NZF-2b/7ZFMyt1 expression, concomitant with strong induction of transcription factors REST1 (RE silencing transcription factor-1) and NAC1, probably leading to regulation of gene expression by interaction with histone deacetylases. These changes lead to decreased responsiveness of the animal to the locomotor-activating effects of cocaine, indicating that NZF-2b/7ZFMyt1 expression plays an important role in phenotypic changes induced by the drug.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the possible role that smoking crack cocaine has on the incidence of HIV infection. Given the increasing use of crack cocaine, we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for HIV infection. METHODS: We included data from people participating in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study who reported injecting illicit drugs at least once in the month before enrolment, lived in the greater Vancouver area, were HIV-negative at enrolment and completed at least 1 follow-up study visit. To determine whether the risk of HIV seroconversion among daily smokers of crack cocaine changed over time, we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods: May 1, 1996–Nov. 30, 1999 (period 1), Dec. 1, 1999–Nov. 30, 2002 (period 2), and Dec. 1, 2002–Dec. 30, 2005 (period 3). RESULTS: Overall, 1048 eligible injection drug users were included in our study. Of these, 137 acquired HIV infection during follow-up. The mean proportion of participants who reported daily smoking of crack cocaine increased from 11.6% in period 1 to 39.7% in period 3. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the risk of HIV seroconversion among participants who were daily smokers of crack cocaine increased over time (period 1: hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57–1.85; period 2: HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01–2.80; and period 3: HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.06–7.11). INTERPRETATION: Smoking of crack cocaine was found to be an independent risk factor for HIV seroconversion among people who were injection drug users. This finding points to the urgent need for evidence-based public health initiatives targeted at people who smoke crack cocaine.

AB  - Ventral tegmental area (VTA) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) contributes to time-dependent increases in cue-induced cocaine seeking after withdrawal (incubation of cocaine craving). Here, we studied the role of glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in incubation of cocaine craving because, like BDNF, GDNF provides trophic support to midbrain dopamine neurons.

AB  - The neural plasticity mechanisms that underlie learning and memory may also be engaged when drug addiction occurs. It was reported that long-lasting neuroadaptations induced by cocaine use and withdrawal require the participation of hippocampus. However, the role of corticotrophin-releasing factor receptors in this process remains unclear. In the present study, the effects of chronic cocaine treatment (a 14-day cocaine administration, 20 mg/kg i.p., daily) and short-term cocaine withdrawal (a 3-day cocaine extinction following a 14-day cocaine administration) on long-term potentiation (LTP), one prominent cellular mechanism for learning and memory, were assessed in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slices. We found that cocaine withdrawal, but not the chronic cocaine administration itself, significantly enhanced the magnitude of LTP in hippocampal slices, as compared with that in saline controls. Selective blockade of corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor subtype 1 (CRF1) with the specific antagonist NBI 27914 (100 nM in vitro) attenuated the magnitude of LTP in hippocampal slices from cocaine withdrawal rats, and intriguingly, also from saline control rats, while specific blockade of corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor subtype 2 (CRF2) with astressin2-B (100 nM in vitro) selectively attenuated the magnitude of LTP in hippocampal slices from cocaine withdrawal rats. Our data suggest that short-term cocaine withdrawal treatment may cause synaptic plasticity in hippocampus partially via changing the activity of CRF2 in the hippocampus.

The effects of some parameters of furnace load with coal on the force resulting in cake collapse and the corresponding compressive stress of the wall lining are quantitativelly analyzed.

AB  - Few studies have examined factors associated with depressive symptoms in crack cocaine smokers, although cocaine use has been linked to depression. The purpose of this study was to identify correlates of depressive symptoms in a sample of 799 HIV-positive and HIV-seronegative African-American crack cocaine smokers. Multiple regression modelling revealed that anxiety was strongly and positively associated with depressive symptoms. In addition, being female and more frequent crack smoking were also found to be associated. Higher self-esteem and decision-making confidence were found to be associated with less often experiencing depressive symptoms. The model accounted for 64% of the variance in the data. It was noteworthy that HIV infection, as such, was not associated with depressive symptoms. The study has important implication for mental health and health promotion interventions targeting crack cocaine smokers.

AB  - Background: Identifying treatments that produce specific benefits in nondrug psychosocial functioning areas such as employment functioning has been illusive. Examination of dimensions of clinical status that moderate such effects may be useful in planning more effective interventions. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine if life stress and four dimensions of personality and psychopathology previously found to predict early post-treatment relapse in diverse groups of substance abusers, predict less recovery in employment functioning among 240 cocaine dependent males after completion of residential treatment. Methods: Latent growth curve analysis was used to determine if antisocial, avoidant, dependent, paranoid-delusional personality dimensions, and life event stress predict employment problem severity evident at drug treatment discharge and change in employment problems over three 3-month follow-up intervals. Results: Individuals with higher employment severity at intake and those who spent less time in treatment tended to have greater employment problems at the predischarge. Two covariates were significant predictors of the linear growth component, and the set of covariates explained approximately 18% of the variation in the linear growth rates. Individuals with higher paranoid/delusional scores and lower educational attainment experienced less improvement in their employment status over follow-up. Conclusions: Current findings appear consistent with those of McLellan and colleagues who found that greater psychiatric severity predicts poor response to treatment across multiple psychosocial outcomes including employment status. Clinical Significance: More intensive and long-term psychiatric treatment and vocational-educational rehabilitative services may be required for improvement in employment functioning among those with relatively severe psychopathology.

AB  - Cocaine-induced neuroplasticity changes in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine systems are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of cocaine dependence. Since neurotrophic factors have been observed to prevent/reverse and mimic cocaine-induced neurobiological changes in the brain, related genes are plausible candidates for susceptibility to cocaine dependence. The novel conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor protein (CDNF) promotes the survival, growth, and function of dopamine-specific neurons and is expressed in brain regions that undergo cocaine-induced neuroplasticity. In this study, we hypothesize that polymorphisms in the CDNFgene (CDNF/ARMETL1) contribute to increased risk for cocaine dependence. Cocaine dependent individuals (n=351) and unaffected controls (n=257) of African descent were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CDNFgene (rs11259365, rs7094179, rs7900873, rs2278871). We observed no significant differences in allele, genotype, or haplotype frequencies between cases and controls for any of the tested SNPs. Our study suggests that there is no association between variants in the CDNFgene and cocaine dependence. However, additional studies using larger sample sizes, comprehensive SNP coverage, and clinically homogenous populations are necessary before confidently excluding CDNFas a significant genetic risk factor for cocaine dependence.

AB  - AbstractEarly developmental treatment of rats with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) was previously found to cause an abnormal pattern of forebrain serotonergic axon density in adulthood consisting of a cortical hypoinnervation and a striatal hyperinnervation. The present study tested the hypothesis that this reorganization was due to regional differences in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Rats received MDMA (10 mg/kg, s.c., b.i.d.) on postnatal days (PD) 1–4, after which brain tissues were collected on PD 11, 30, and 67 for analysis. BDNF protein levels were found to be elevated in the occipital cortex but not in the hippocampus or striatum following MDMA administration. Serotonin transporter binding (an index of serotonergic fiber integrity) was significantly reduced in the hippocampus at PD 11 but returned to normal by PD 30, whereas the cortex exhibited a delayed reduction that was not manifested until PD 30. These results do not support the view that a region-specific enhancement in BDNF expression mediates the abnormal serotonergic reinnervation observed following neonatal MDMA exposure.Copyright © 2009 S.

AB  - Abstract: Rationale: Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and noradrenaline (NA) have been shown in independent studies to mediate stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. To date, however, a functional interaction between the systems in reinstatement has not been demonstrated. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine whether CRF and NA systems can interact to influence reinstatement responding and, if so, in what direction the interaction occurs. Materials and methods: Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.23 mg/kg per infusion) for 8–10 days. Subsequently, responding for drug was extinguished, and tests for reinstatement were conducted following: (1) pretreatment with the CRF receptor antagonist, d-Phe CRF<sub>12–41</sub> [1 μg, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)], prior to i.c.v. injections of NA (10 μg; Experiment 1); (2) pretreatment with the α<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (40 μg/kg, i.p.), prior to i.c.v. injections of CRF (0.5 μg; Experiment 2); (3) pretreatment with d-Phe (1, 5 μg, i.c.v.), prior to systemic injections of the α<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (1.25 mg/kg; Experiment 3A); or (4) pretreatment with clonidine (40 μg/kg, i.p.) prior to systemic injections of yohimbine (0.625 mg/kg, 1.25 mg/kg; Experiment 3B). Results: NA reliably induced reinstatement, an effect that was blocked by pretreatment with d-Phe. In contrast, CRF-induced reinstatement was not attenuated by pretreatment with clonidine. Pretreatment with neither d-Phe nor clonidine was effective in blocking yohimbine-induced reinstatement. Conclusion: Together, the present findings suggest a functional interaction between NA and CRF systems in mediating stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, whereby activation of CRF receptors occurs subsequent to, and downstream of, the sites of action of NA.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate factors associated with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol and other drugs (ecstasy, cannabis and methamphetamine) among a group of regular ecstasy users. Participants were those who participated in the Australian Ecstasy and related Drug Reporting System (EDRS) in 2007 and had recently driven a motor vehicle (n=573). Participants were administered a semi-structured face-to-face interview which included questions about ecstasy and other drug use, associated health-related issues, and risk behaviours. Close to half of those who were current consumers of ecstasy, cannabis, and methamphetamine had recently driven under the influence of these drugs, while two-fifths of current alcohol users reported recent drink driving. Frequency of use for each substance was the most significant correlate of DUI of alcohol, cannabis, and methamphetamine, suggesting that interventions targeting high frequency and problematic drug use may be useful in reducing the occurrence of DUI for these substances. Low perception of the likelihood of having an accident was the most significant correlate of DUI of ecstasy and also related significantly to DUI of other substances. Perceptions of low likelihood of being apprehended by police and demographic characteristics such as younger age and male sex were also weakly associated with DUI. Together these findings have important implications for targeted interventions aimed at reducing the occurrence of DUI among regular drug users.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to ketamine, a NMDA receptor antagonist, results in accelerated neurodegeneration and attenuated weight gain in neonatal rats. Suppression of the NMDA receptors by non-competitive antagonists has resulted in conflicting reports of both increased and decreased expression of BDNF. To examine the effect of prolonged ketamine exposure on BDNF expression, we administered saline or ketamine (20mg/kg) at 90-minute intervals over 9 hours to postnatal day 7 (P7) rat pups. The ketamine-treated rat pups had increased neurodegeneration, BDNF and TrkB cDNA products and protein levels. This increased expression of BDNF may be a response to ketamine-induced injury.

AB  - A cross-sectional epidemiological study was performed on 286 workers from two coke oven and one graphite electrode plants. The aim was to evaluate the usefulness of monitoring 1-hydroxypyrene (1-HOP) in urine for assessing exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and that of the urinary excretion of thioethers and D-glucaric acid, and the mutagenic activity of urine as indicators or biological effects of PAHs. The results confirm that 1-HOP determination in urine probably reflects exposure to PAHs by all routes and is not significantly influenced by the smoking habit. In comparison with the total PAHs in the air and 1-hydroxypyrene in urine, taken as reference exposure parameters, the results indicate that urinary D-glucaric acid excretion is not positively influenced by PAHs exposure; thioethers determination in urine is of poor value, since the smoking habit is a strong confounding factor. The determination of urinary mutagenicity might contribute to the detection of groups of workers exposed to potentially genotoxic PAHs.

AB  - In vertebrates, including fish, environmental temperature influences feeding through mechanisms that are unclear. We investigated the effects of three different temperatures on food consumption and brain messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of two hypothalamic appetite-regulating factors, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), which stimulates and inhibits feeding, respectively. Atlantic cod acclimated to 2?C for 4?wk had a decreased food intake and higher CART brain mRNA levels compared to fish acclimated to 11 and 15?C. No differences were seen in NPY mRNA expression between the three groups. Our results suggest that in cod, low temperatures inhibit food intake, and this inhibition is in part mediated by an increase in CART expression but does not involve changes in NPY expression.

AB  - A growing body of evidence has pointed to the blockade of the N-methyl- d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of major depression. The present study was aimed to evaluate behavioural and molecular effects of the chronic treatment with ketamine and imipramine in rats. To this aim, rats were 14 days treated once a day with ketamine (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg) and imipramine (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg) and then subjected to the forced swimming and open-field tests. Ketamine and imipramine, at the all doses tested, reduced immobility time, and increased both climbing and swimming time of rats compared to the saline group, without affecting spontaneous locomotor activity. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) hippocampal levels were assessed in imipramine- and ketamine-treated rats by ELISA sandwich assay. Chronic administration of both drugs, ketamine and imipramine, did not modify BDNF protein levels in the rat hippocampus. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate for the first time that chronic administration of acute inactive doses of ketamine (5 mg/kg) becomes active after chronic treatment, while no signs of tolerance to the behavioural effects of ketamine were observed after chronic administration of acute active doses (10 and 15 mg/kg). Finally, these findings further support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor could be a new pharmacological target for the treatment of mood disorders.

AB  - AbstractThe purposes of this study are to (1) examine the extent to which young adult Ecstasy users recently reported having had multiple sex partners and (2) identify the factors predictive of engaging in this behavior. Potential predictors included demographic characteristics, background and experiences measures, childhood maltreatment experiences, substance use variables, and measures assessing psychological/psychosocial functioning. This research is based on a sample of 283 young adult recurrent users of the drug, Ecstasy. Study participants were recruited in Atlanta, Georgia between August 2002 and August 2004 using a targeted sampling and ethnographic mapping approach. Interviews took approximately two hours to complete. Nearly one-third of the study participants had more than one sex partner during the preceding month, and sexual protection rates tended to be low. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed seven predictors associated with an increased likelihood of having multiple sex partners: (1) being nonwhite, (2) knowing someone who. was HIV-positive, (3) younger age of first sexual experience, (4) using Ecstasy for its touch-enhancing qualities, (5) higher self-esteem, (6) handling disagreements more dysfunctionally, and (7) not being involved in a romantic relationship. The HIV prevention- and intervention-related implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Abstract: Aim: To analyse drug consumption patterns and demographic and medical factors associated with health-related quality of life (HRQL) in a nonclinical sample of regular cocaine consumers. Methods: Face-to-face interviews with 687 young regular cocaine users (aged 18–30 years) in three Spanish cities: Barcelona, Madrid and Seville. HRQL was measured using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and degree of dependence through the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS). Bivariate analyses were conducted using nonparametric techniques, and a Tobit regression analysis was carried out to determine which variables best explained HRQL. Results: Most participants showed a good HRQL, but differences in HRQL were found for sociodemographic (gender), medical (days stayed in bed during the previous 12 months) and consumption-pattern related variables (length of drug use, intravenous drug use, crack use, SDS). In multivariate analyses cocaine dependence measured by SDS explained the greatest amount of HRQL variation. Although women declared worse HRQL (13.6 versus 9.7, P < 0.01), in the final model with interactions no gender differences were observed, except that HRQL for women worsened with the number of days they had stayed in bed in the previous 12 months. Conclusions: Even in early phases of dependence, deterioration in HRQL is observed, mainly related to drug-use history and patterns.

AB  - Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide is an endogenous peptide which is widely expressed in the CNS and PNS as well as in endocrine cells. Despite the functional knowledge about CART, the mechanisms that regulate CART gene transcription are poorly characterized. Here, we showed that neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) functions as a negative regulator of CART gene expression in neuroendocrine cells. A putative neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) conserved between the rodent and human CART promoter was identified and demonstrated to bind to NRSF in sequence-specific manner by the electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Ectopic expression of NRSF in pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) and insulin-secreting cells (INS-1) induced a marked reduction in the level of CART mRNA and the activity of CART promoter or NRSE reporter. The CART promoter showed very low activity in endogenous NRSF-expressing HeLa cells. When expression of NRSF was down-regulated in HeLa cells using a RNA interfering technique, the transcriptional activity of the CART promoter or a NRSE reporter was significantly increased. Taken together, our data suggested that CART gene expression in neuroendocrine cells is strictly controlled by NRSF, via a mechanism dependent upon the CART NRSE.

AB  - The neurotrophic factors play an important role in the maintenance of neurone viability and neuronal communication which are considered to be altered in schizophrenia. Subchronic application of ketamine (Ket) was found to be a useful model in schizophrenia research. To further validate this model the mRNA levels of neurotrophic factors NGF, NT- 3, and BDNF and their receptors TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, respectively, were measured in different brain areas in Ketpretreated rats subchronically dosed with the atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone (Ris). With the exception of NGF in the frontal cortex, Ket pretreatment did change NGF, NT-3, and BDNF mRNA levels in the frontal cortex, the hippocampus, the striatum, the thalamus/hypothalamus region, and in the cerebellum. These changes correspond with changes at their tyrosine kinase receptors. Ris treatment normalised altered NT-3 levels in the hippocampus and balanced BDNF levels in the same structure. It was concluded that the Ket model might reflect distinct alterations in neurotrophic factor activity as found in schizophrenic patients and, moreover, that Ris treatment rebalances disturbed neurotrophic factor activity.

AB  - Our previous study showed that ketamine, an intravenous anesthetic agent, has anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we further evaluated the effects of ketamine on the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interlukin-6 (IL-6) gene expressions and its possible signal-transducing mechanisms in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. Exposure of macrophages to 1, 10, and 100 μM ketamine, 100 ng/ml LPS, or a combination of ketamine and LPS for 1, 6, and 24 h was not cytotoxic to macrophages. A concentration of 1000 μM of ketamine alone or in combined treatment with LPS caused significant cell death. Administration of LPS increased cellular TNF-α and IL-6 protein levels in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Meanwhile, treatment with ketamine concentration- and time-dependently alleviated the enhanced effects. LPS induced TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA syntheses. Administration of ketamine at a therapeutic concentration (100 μM) significantly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expressions. Application of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) small interfering (si)RNA into macrophages decreased cellular TLR4 levels. Co-treatment of macrophages with ketamine and TLR4 siRNA decreased the LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 productions more than alone administration of TLR4 siRNA. LPS stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and translocation of c-Jun and c-Fos from the cytoplasm to nuclei. However, administration of ketamine significantly decreased LPS-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and translocation of c-Jun and c-Fos. LPS increased the binding of nuclear extracts to activator protein-1 consensus DNA oligonucleotides. Administration of ketamine significantly ameliorated LPS-induced DNA binding activity of activator protein-1. Therefore, a clinically relevant concentration of ketamine can inhibit TNF-α and IL-6 gene expressions in LPS-activated macrophages. The suppressive mechanisms occur through suppression of TLR4-mediated sequential activations of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and activator protein-1.

AB  - Hair samples were contaminated by rubbing with cocaine (COC) followed by sweat application, multiple shampoo treatments and storage. The samples were then washed with isopropanol for 15min, followed by sequential aqueous washes totaling 3.5h. The amount of drug in the last wash was used to calculate a wash criterion to determine whether samples were positive due to use or contamination. Analyses of cocaine and metabolites were done by LC/MS/MS. These procedures were applied to samples produced by a U.S. government-sponsored cooperative study, in which this laboratory participated, and to samples in a parallel in-house study. All contaminated samples in both studies were correctly identified as contaminated by cutoff, benzoylecgonine (BE) presence, BE ratio, and/or the wash criterion. A method for determining hair porosity was applied to samples in both studies, and porosity characteristics of hair are discussed as they relate to experimental and real-world contamination of hair, preparation of proficiency survey samples, and analysis of unknown hair samples.

AB  - ABSTRACTPatients living with human immunodeficiency virus represent a growing population, and an increased number of central nervous system presentations can be expected over the next decade. Emerging data suggests that both HIV-seropositive patients and cocaine-abusing patients may be at special risk of seizure phenomena. This case report discusses the risks of new-onset seizure activity when these two risk factors converge, which is a common occurrence in this population. Data from the fields of neuroanatomy and neurovirology are presented to explain the heightened risk of this patient population and provide the practitioner with an improved understanding of the central nervous system complexities in HIV.

AB  - ObjectiveOne objective was to determine if cocaine-using women who did not maintain infant custody (NMC) would report more psychological distress, domestic violence, negative coping skills, lower social support and more childhood trauma than cocaine-using women who maintained custody (MC) of their infant. A second objective was to evaluate the relative contribution of psychosocial factors to infant placement.MethodsPsychosocial profiles of MC women (n=144) were compared with NMC (n=66) cocaine-using women. Subjects were low income, urban, African-American women who delivered an infant at a county teaching hospital. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), an assessment of coping strategies (COPE), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were administered. The associations of infant placement status to demographic factors, drug use and psychosocial measures were evaluated.ResultsThe NMC group reported greater overall psychological distress, psychoticism, somatization, anxiety and hostility than the MC group. The NMC group had more childhood neglect and physical abuse and used more negative coping strategies than the MC group. Lack of prenatal care [OR=.83, CI (.75–.91), p<.0001], heavier prenatal cocaine use [OR=2.55, CI (1.13–4.34), p<.007], greater psychological distress [OR=2.21, CI (1.13–4.34), p<.02] and a childhood history of emotional neglect [OR=1.10, CI (1.02–1.19), p<.02] were associated with increased likelihood of loss of infant custody after control for other substance use and demographic variables.ConclusionsNMC women have more negative psychological and behavioral functioning post-partum than MC women. Less prenatal care and greater cocaine use, psychological distress and maternal childhood emotional neglect are associated with the post-partum placement of infants born to cocaine-using women.Practice implicationsResults of this study indicate that poor, urban women who use cocaine prenatally display several measurable differences on psychosocial and behavioral risk factors based on child placement status. Among these risk factors heavier cocaine use, lack of prenatal care, more severe psychological symptoms and early childhood experiences of emotional neglect increase the likelihood of loss of infant custody. Routine, objective assessments of psychosocial and behavioral characteristics of women who use cocaine during pregnancy can aid Child Protective Service workers and clinicians by providing baseline data from which to tailor interventions and set improvement criteria for mother-child reunification.

AB  - Abstract: Rationale: Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), a protein involved in survival and maintenance of several cell phenotypes as well as in synaptic plasticity, is modulated by stress (Molteni et al., Brain Res Rev 37:249–258, 2001; Fumagalli et al., Neurobiol Dis 20:731–737, 2005) and cocaine (Fumagalli et al., J Neurochem 96:996–1004, 2006). Objectives: Since it is widely recognized that stress influences drug seeking, we decided to investigate whether stress, acute or repeated, could influence the changes in FGF-2 gene expression brought about by cocaine. Results: Our data demonstrate that stress and cocaine interact to produce significant changes on FGF-2 expression in rat prefrontal cortex and striatum. In prefrontal cortex, our experiments demonstrated that a single exposure to stress potentiated cocaine-induced FGF-2 elevation, whereas prolonged stress prevented the modulation of the trophic factor in response to cocaine. In striatum, the magnitude of cocaine-induced FGF-2 response is enhanced by repeated stress, whereas no interaction was observed when acute stress and single exposure to cocaine were combined. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that stress interacts with cocaine to alter the pattern of FGF-2 expression in a way that depends on whether stress is acute or chronic and in a regionally selective fashion. These results identify a potential molecular target through which stress alters cellular sensitivity to cocaine and might prove useful in understanding the mechanisms underlying brain vulnerability to stress.

AB  - Abstract: Rationale: Stressful events during periods of drug abstinence likely contribute to relapse in cocaine-dependent individuals. Excessive cocaine use may increase susceptibility to stressor-induced relapse through alterations in brain corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) responsiveness. Objectives: This study examined stressor- and CRF-induced cocaine seeking and other stress-related behaviors in rats with different histories of cocaine self-administration (SA). Materials and methods: Rats self-administered cocaine under short-access (ShA; 2 h daily) or long-access (LgA; 6 h daily) conditions for 14 days or were provided access to saline and were tested for reinstatement by a stressor (electric footshock), cocaine or an icv injection of CRF and for behavioral responsiveness on the elevated plus maze, in a novel environment and in the light–dark box after a 14- to 17-day extinction/withdrawal period. Results: LgA rats showed escalating patterns of cocaine SA and were more susceptible to reinstatement by cocaine, EFS, or icv CRF than ShA rats. Overall, cocaine SA increased activity in the center field of a novel environment, on the open arms of the elevated plus maze, and in the light compartment of a light–dark box. In most cases, the effects of cocaine SA were dependent on the pattern/amount of cocaine intake with statistically significant differences from saline self-administering controls only observed in LgA rats. Conclusions: When examined after several weeks of extinction/withdrawal, cocaine SA promotes a more active pattern of behavior during times of stress that is associated with a heightened susceptibility to stressor-induced cocaine-seeking behavior and may be the consequence of augmented CRF regulation of addiction-related neurocircuitry.

AB  - OBJECTIVES. Maternal cocaine use is a leading grounds for newborn foster placement. This study was initiated to investigate the factors that predict custody status of infants born to substance-abusing women. METHODS. A retrospective cohort design was used to study the correlates of discharge custody decisions for 99 consecutive infants testing positive for cocaine in a public hospital. RESULTS. The population was 49% Black, 40% Hispanic, and 11% other or unknown. Custody at discharge was to mothers (38%), other family members (25%), or agency foster care (36%). Placement outside the family was greater when mothers had prior child welfare records, in Blacks vs others, with no prenatal care, and when mothers were younger at their first delivery or older at the index birth. Denial of custody to the mother was higher with prior child welfare involvement, in Blacks, and when the mother did not live in her own home. Both models also controlled for parity, child sex, and birthweight. CONCLUSIONS. Earlier involvement with child welfare authorities, race, and other factors predict continued separation of mothers and children at newborn discharge, suggesting the need to reexamine current policies and practices.

AB  - Chronic cocaine and heroin users display a variety of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunctions including impaired attention, learning, memory, reaction time, cognitive flexibility, impulse control and selective processing. These findings suggest that these drugs may alter normal brain functions and possibly cause neurotoxicity. Neurotrophins are a class of proteins that serve as survival factors for CNS neurons. In particular, nerve growth factor (NGF) plays an important role in the survival and function of cholinergic neurons while brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in synaptic plasticity and in the maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. In the present study, we measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the NGF and BDNF levels in serum of three groups of subjects: heroin-dependent patients, cocaine-dependent patients and healthy volunteers. Our goal was to identify possible change in serum neurotrophins in heroin and cocaine users. BDNF was decreased in heroin users whereas NGF was decreased in both heroin and cocaine users. These findings indicate that NGF and BDNF may play a role in the neurotoxicity and addiction induced by these drugs. In view of the neurotrophin hypothesis of schizophrenia the data also suggest that reduced level of neurotrophins may increase the risk of developing psychosis in drug users.

AB  - Eighty former cocaine sellers, mostly wholesalers, were recruited for a study exploring the reasons people stop selling cocaine. The motivations to stop selling were often complex. Forty percent of the respondents reported criminal justice concerns, however 45% cited psychological problems and 35% physical health problems. The majority of the sellers cited relationship and sexual problems. Nearly a third reported that pressures from a spouse or lover were important to their decision to quit, and about 20% claimed pressures from family (children, parents, etc.) helped shape their decision. When asked to rank the most important reasons why they stopped selling cocaine, two out of every five reported they "disliked the lifestyle associated with drug sales." This meant a combination of their own drug use, psychological and physical problems, the illegal nature of the activity, and the problems dealing with other drug users and sellers.

AB  - Psychostimulants activate the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras-MAPK) cascade in the limbic reward circuit and thereby trigger a transcription-dependent mechanism underlying enduring synaptic plasticity related to addictive properties of drugs of abuse. The Ras-specific activator, Ras-guanine nucleotide-releasing factor (Ras-GRF), is predominantly expressed at synapses and is thought to actively regulate Ras-MAPK responses to changing synaptic signals. In this study, a possible influence of cocaine on Ras-GRF gene expression at the protein level in the rat striatum was investigated in vivo. A single systemic injection of cocaine induced an increase in Ras-GRF1 protein levels in both the dorsal (caudoputamen) and ventral (nucleus accumbens) striatum. The increase in Ras-GRF1 proteins was dose-dependent and was a delayed and transient event. In contrast to Ras-GRF1, a closely related Ras-GRF2 showed no change in its protein abundance following cocaine administration. These data identify the Ras activator, Ras-GRF1, although not Ras-GRF2, as a susceptible target to cocaine stimulation in striatal neurons.

AB  - CONTEXT Although genetic risk factors have been found to contribute to dependence on both licit and illicit psychoactive substances, we know little of how these risk factors interrelate. OBJECTIVE To clarify the structure of genetic and environmental risk factors for symptoms of dependence on cannabis, cocaine, alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine in males and females. DESIGN Lifetime history by structured clinical interview. SETTING General community. PARTICIPANTS Four thousand eight hundred sixty-five members of male-male and female-female pairs from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Lifetime symptoms of abuse of and dependence on cannabis, cocaine, alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. RESULTS Controlling for greater symptom prevalence in males, genetic and environmental parameters could be equated across sexes. Two models explained the data well. The best-fit exploratory model contained 2 genetic factors and 1 individual environmental factor contributing to all substances. The first genetic factor loaded strongly on cocaine and cannabis dependence; the second, on alcohol and nicotine dependence. Nicotine and caffeine had high substance-specific genetic effects. A confirmatory model, which also fit well, contained 1 illicit drug genetic factor—loading only on cannabis and cocaine—and 1 licit drug genetic factor loading on alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. However, these factors were highly intercorrelated (r = + 0.82). Large substance-specific genetic effects remained for nicotine and caffeine. CONCLUSIONS The pattern of genetic and environmental risk factors for psychoactive substance dependence was similar in males and females. Genetic risk factors for dependence on common psychoactive substances cannot be explained by a single factor. Rather, 2 genetic factors—one predisposing largely to illicit drug dependence, the other primarily to licit drug dependence—are needed. Furthermore, a large proportion of the genetic influences on nicotine and particularly caffeine dependence appear to be specific to those substances.Arch Gen Psychiatry.2007;64(11):1313-1320--

AB  - The purpose of the study was to do an exploratory factor analysis and to examine the criterion-related and discriminant validity of the Lifetime Severity Index for Cocaine (LSI-C), Spanish version. A sample of 171 outpatients from 10 drug centers in Spain participated in the study. We conducted the factor analysis with orthogonal rotation and examined correlations between the LSI-C total score and criterion variables as well as the score obtained by a quality of life measure. The factor analysis revealed 2 principal factors that explain 65.8% of the variance. Lower LSI-C scores were associated with taking medication, receiving social help, using cocaine fewer than 30 times during the previous 6 months, and with better scores on quality of life measures. Higher LSI-C scores were associated with unstable housing, overdose, hospitalization, cocaine consumption more than 100 times during the previous 6 months, and more years of drug consumption. The LSI-C Spanish version shows acceptable criterion-related and discriminant validity.

AB  - Studies have investigated the potential effects of prenatal cocaine exposure (CE) on children's development. However, few studies have examined predictors of resilient outcomes in this population. We examined vagal tone (VT) as a resilience factor in prenatal CE. Utilizing data from the Maternal Lifestyle Study, a cumulative risk index was derived for children with and without prenatal CE. Presence of CE and other prenatal drugs was summed with postnatal risks in infancy to yield a 15-item risk index. Preschool cognitive outcomes, problem behaviors, and adaptive behaviors were measured. VT was assessed during an infant exam at 1 month and toy exploration at 36 months. We included children with complete physiologic data (217 CE, 333 non-CE). Children were classified as having consistently high, consistently low, or fluctuating VT at 1 and 36 months. Children were also classified as high versus low risk. High-risk children had lower IQ scores, more problem behaviors, and lower ratings of adaptive behaviors than low-risk children. A significant risk by VT–stability interaction indicated that for high-risk children, those with stable low VT had higher ratings of adaptive behaviors at 36 months. This is consistent with theory linking reduced VT during tasks to adaptive regulation and indicates that such regulatory functioning may serve as a protective factor in prenatal CE.

AB  - AbstractCocaine addiction is one of the severest health problems faced by western countries, where there is an increasing prevalence of lifelong abuse. The most challenging aspects in the treatment of cocaine addiction are craving and relapse, especially in view of the fact that, at present, there is a lack of effective pharmacological treatment for the disorder. What is required are new pharmacological approaches based on our current understanding of the neurobiological bases of drug addiction. Within the context of the behavioral and neurochemical actions of cocaine, this paper considers the contribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its main intracellular signaling mechanisms, including mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), in psychostimulant addiction. Repeated cocaine administration leads to an increase in BDNF levels and enhanced activity in the intracellular pathways (PI3K and MAPK/ERK) in the reward-related brain areas, which applies especially several days following withdrawal. It has been hypothesized that these neurochemical changes contribute to the enduring synaptic plasticity that underlies sensitized responses to psychostimulants and drug-conditioned memories leading to compulsive drug use and frequent relapse after withdrawal. Nevertheless, increased BDNF levels could also have a role as a protection factor in addiction. The inhibition of the intracellular pathways, ERK and PI3K, leads to a disruption in sensitized responses and conditioned memories associated with cocaine addiction and suggests new, potential therapeutic strategies to explore in the dependence on psychostimulants.Copyright © 2007 S.

AB  - Objective: This study identifies self-reported factors facilitating initiation of cocaine and heroin among young problem users in Amsterdam to enable interventions to be targeted at issues personally relevant for this population. Method: A qualitative study using in-depth interviews to obtain retrospective drug use histories. Recruitment took place both directly (by street outreach, outreach at methadone outposts) and indirectly (by respondent-driven sampling). The study started in the year 2001 and included 50 problem drug users, aged 18-30, of whom 72% were male, 64% were polydrug users, and 36% were homeless. Results: The seven most common self-reported factors facilitating initiation of cocaine and heroin are desire for affect regulation, drug availability, curiosity, desire to be part of a group, misinformation, desire for energy, and starting because it has a depressant effect. Conclusion: Some factors perceived to facilitate initiation of cocaine and/or heroin revealed in this study are hardly addressed by current prevention programs and could inform future initiatives. Programs can be targeted at young people who we identified to be at high risk. Research using quantitative methods is likely to be valuable in determining the relative importance of mentioned factors for different groups of young people. The study's limitations are noted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cocaine is a sympathomimetic agent that can cause coronary artery vasospasm leading to myocardial ischaemia, acute coronary syndrome and acute myocardial infarction (ACS/AMI). The management of cocaine-induced ACS/AMI is different to classical atheromatous ACS/MI, because the mechanisms are different. METHODS: Knowledge study—Junior medical staff were given a scenario of a patient with ACS and asked to identify potential risk factors for ACS and which ones they routinely asked about in clinical practice. Retrospective study—Retrospective notes reviews of patients with suspected and proven (elevated troponin T concentration) ACS were undertaken to determine the recording of cocaine use/non-use in clinical notes. RESULTS: Knowledge study—There was no significant difference in the knowledge that cocaine was a risk factor compared to other "classical" cardiovascular risk factors, but juniors doctors were less likely to ask routinely about cocaine use compared to other "classical" risk factors (52.9% vs >90%, respectively). Retrospective study—Cocaine use or non-use was documented in 3.7% (4/109) and 4% (2/50) of clinical notes of patients with suspected and proven ACS, respectively. DISCUSSION: Although junior medical staff are aware that cocaine is a risk factor for ACS/AMI, they are less likely to ask about it in routine clinical practice or record its use/non-use in clinical notes. It is essential that patients presenting with suspected ACS are asked about cocaine use, since the management of these patients is different to those with ACS secondary to "classical" cardiovascular risk factors.

AB  - Previous studies showed that cocaine exposure decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) function and resulted in neuronal cell death. To investigate a role of BDNF in cocaine's cytotoxicity, an RNA interference (RNAi) approach was used. Transfection of neuroblastoma SK-N-AS cells or primary rat hippocampal neurons with the small double-stranded interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting BDNF mRNA, but not the scrambled siRNA, resulted in reductions in levels of BDNF mRNA and proteins by more than 70% in the transfected cells as compared with the control group, suggesting an RNAi-mediated, sequence-specific gene silencing. The results also showed that cocaine-induced cytotoxicity, assessed by the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazodium bromide) assay, was more pronounced in the cells transfected with the siRNA than in the cells transfected with the scrambled siRNA or in the cells treated with Lipofectamine 2000 alone (the control group), suggesting that inhibition of BDNF expression enhances cocaine's cytotoxicity. Together with previous studies showing that cocaine suppresses BDNF expression, the present data suggest that the drug-induced reduction of BDNF productions may make neurons more vulnerable to cocaine's toxic effects and precipitate cocaine-induced central nervous system damages.

AB  - Chronic cocaine use leads to pronounced alterations in neuronal functions in brain circuits associated with reward. In the present study, we examined in the rat midbrain the effects of acute, subchronic (5 days) and chronic cocaine treatments (14 days) on the gene expression of transcription factors involved in the development and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons. We show that chronic, but not acute or subchronic, cocaine administration downregulates Nurr1 and Pitx3 transcripts whereas En1 transcripts are upregulated. Conversely, Lmx1b and En2 transcripts are not affected by the drug treatment, indicating that the modulation of the midbrain transcription factors analyzed is highly selective. Interestingly, modification of the gene expression for these transcription factors persists in midbrain as long as two weeks after the last drug administration, suggesting that it may account for some of the enduring alterations in midbrain dopaminergic circuits associated with chronic cocaine use.

AB  - Objective:To identify the risk factors for recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in a city hospital.Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of sequential adult admissions for DKA at Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center in New York between July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2004. The patients were divided into cohorts, which were compared with use of analysis of variance and X2tests. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed where indicated.Results:In 168 patients (96 men and 72 women), 219 episodes of DKA occurred. The mean age (± SD) of the overall study group was 38.6 ± 14.8 years. Fifty-four patients (32%) had type 2 diabetes, and 44 patients (26%) had new-onset diabetes. The recurrence rate of DKA was 169% in cocaine users and 39% in nonusers (P<0.0001). Active use of cocaine, noncompliance, and Hispanic ethnicity emerged as independent risk factors for recurrent DKA—odds ratio (OR) = 4.38, P= 0.001; OR = 1.96, P= 0.05; and OR = 0.40, P= 0.005, respectively. The commonest precipitants of DKA were noncompliance (44%) and infection (26%). Noncompliance was associated with use of cocaine, use of cannabis, and cigarette smoking (P= 0.008, 0.04, and 0.01, respectively). In 91 of the hospital admissions for DKA (42%), the patients were active smokers.Conclusion:Active use of cocaine is an independent risk factor for recurrent DKA, as are noncompliance and Hispanic ethnicity. Of these 3 factors, cocaine showed the strongest association with DKA. Therefore, toxicology screening in patients with recurrent DKA may be prudent and worthwhile.

AB  - Objective: Cocaine-induced paranoia (CIP), an irrational intense suspicion of others, is a common manifestation of cocaine dependence. Both environmental and genetic factors are thought to play a role, but the specific nature of such contributions is poorly understood. Methods: Demographic, diagnostic, and cocaine-use data were obtained from 420 cocaine-dependent, genetically confirmed, full-sibling pairs (N=840 subjects) interviewed with the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA). Probands with and without CIP were compared; then, factors associated with sibling CIP status were analyzed by logistic regression. Alcohol dependence, a known heritable phenotype, was analyzed as a positive control. Results: Of 420 probands, 273 (65%) experienced CIP. Probands with CIP were more severely dependent upon cocaine, had an earlier age of onset, were more likely to smoke cocaine, and used cocaine less frequently during the preceding year. Independent analyses of siblings replicated two of the former (i.e., dependence severity and age of onset). Probands with CIP also had a non-significantly higher proportion of siblings with the trait (66% versus 59%). Probands with concurrent alcohol dependence were confirmed to have significantly higher rates of alcoholism among their siblings. Conclusions: Severity of cocaine dependence and age of onset appear to be important risk factors for CIP. Concordance for CIP between siblings did not emerge as significant in our analyses.

AB  - Cocaine consumption can lead to myocardial infarction. Tissue factor (TF) has been implicated in acute coronary syndromes, and the balance of TF and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) determines initiation of thrombus formation. This study was designed to investigate the effect of cocaine on endothelial TF and TFPI expression. Cocaine (10−8-10−5 mol/l) increased thrombin-induced TF expression by 24% at 10−7 mol/l (P<0.001) without affecting basal TF expression. In contrast, cocaine reduced endothelial TFPI expression by 47% at 10−7 mol/l (P<0.01). Moreover, thrombin impaired endothelial TFPI expression, and cocaine (10−8 mol/l) further reduced TFPI expression by 33% as compared to thrombin (P<0.02). These effects occur at cocaine concentrations usually present in plasma of consumers. Given the importance of TF in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes, TF induction in conjunction with TFPI suppression may be relevant for the increased frequency of myocardial infarction observed in cocaine consumers.

AB  - Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) has been implicated in a number of the behavioral and biochemical effects of cocaine. We recently reported that central injections of CRF produce a potentiated locomotor response in animals that had been given repeated injections of cocaine up to 4 weeks earlier. We now report that with as few as 1 or 3 exposures to cocaine (total of 45mg/kg, i.p., per day), and a drug-free period of 28 days, i.c.v. injections of CRF (0.5@mg) produce augmented locomotor responses, similar to those induced by cocaine (10mg/kg, i.p.) itself. In addition, in animals pre-exposed to cocaine for 3 days, pre-treatment with the CRF receptor antagonist, D-Phe CRF"1"2"-"4"1 (1@mg, i.c.v.), blocks the expression of behavioral sensitization to a cocaine challenge after a 28-day drug-free period. These results demonstrate that short-term exposure to cocaine produces a form of long-term sensitization within systems upon which CRF acts and that activation of CRF receptors is importantly involved in the expression of behavioral sensitization to cocaine.

AB  - Cocaine addiction is an enduring, relapsing, behavioural disorder in which stressors reinstate cocaine‐seeking even after prolonged abstinence. Evidence suggests that the ‘anxiety‐like’ behaviour and stress associated with protracted withdrawal may be mediated by increased corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a part of the limbic circuitry engaged in the coding and transmission of stimulus–reward associations. In the present study we describe a long‐lasting potentiation of glutamatergic transmission induced at lateral amygdala (LA)‐to‐CeA synapses by rat/human CRF. After 2 weeks of withdrawal from repeated intermittent exposure to cocaine, CRF‐induced long‐term potentiation (LTP) was greatly enhanced compared to the respective saline control group while, after short‐term withdrawal (24 h), there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups, indicating alterations in CRF systems during protracted withdrawal from chronic cocaine. After prolonged withdrawal, CRF‐induced LTP was dependent on activation of CRF2, CaV2.3 (R‐type) calcium channels and intracellular signalling through protein kinase C in both saline‐ and cocaine‐treated groups. The enhanced CRF‐induced LTP after 2 weeks of withdrawal was mediated through augmented CRF1receptor function, associated with an increased signalling through protein kinase A, and required N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Accordingly, single‐cell recordings revealed a significantly increased NMDA/AMPA ratio after prolonged withdrawal from the cocaine treatment. These results support a role for CRF1receptor antagonists as plausible treatment options during withdrawal from chronic cocaine and suggest CaV2.3 blockers as potential candidates for pharmaceutical modulation of CRF systems.

AB  - Anxiety-like behaviors emerge with repeated exposure to and short-term withdrawal from cocaine. The stress-related neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), has been implicated in the anxiogenic effects of cocaine withdrawal, as well as in some of the long-lasting effects of cocaine. One objective of the present experiments was to determine whether repeated exposures to cocaine, under conditions that induce anxiety in the initial withdrawal period, would induce longer-lasting anxiogenic responses. A second objective was to determine whether any such effects would be potentiated by CRF. In Experiment 1, animals were injected once daily for 7 days with cocaine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline in the home cages and, after a 10-day drug-free period, were given an i.c.v. injection of CRF (0.5 or 5.0 @mg) or vehicle, followed by a 5-min test for anxiety in the elevated plus maze or light-dark transition apparatus. In Experiment 2, animals were given the cocaine or saline injections in a distinct environment. At test, they were placed in the distinct environment after the CRF (0.5 @mg) or vehicle injection and were subsequently tested for anxiety. Cocaine produced enhanced levels of anxiety when pre-exposures were given in a distinct environment, but not when they were given in the home cage. In neither case did cocaine differentially alter anxiety-like responses to CRF. The results suggest that a ''reminder'' of the drug experience, such as re-exposure to cocaine-paired contextual cues, may be necessary to induce elevated levels of anxiety after the initial withdrawal period. In addition, although the results do not rule out a role for endogenous CRF in lasting cocaine-induced anxiogenic responses, they suggest that an increased sensitivity of CRF receptors to the peptide is not responsible for the effect.

AB  - Once bound to methylated CpG sites, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is thought to silence transcription of downstream genes by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC). Mutations within the MeCP2 gene have been found to cause Rett syndrome, a disorder of arrested neuronal development. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that Mecp2, as well as the methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD1, were significantly induced in normal adult rat brain after repeated injections of fluoxetine or cocaine for 10 days (one injection per day). Mecp2 was not induced by repeated injections of 1-(2-bis(4-fluorphenyl)-methoxy)-ethyl)-4-(3-phenyl-propyl)piperazine (GBR-12909) or nortriptyline. Together, the data indicate that the serotonergic system is predominantly involved. Using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments, MBD1 mRNA and both Mecp2_e1 and Mecp2_e2 transcripts were found to be induced by fluoxetine. Induction of the methylbinding proteins was accompanied with enhanced HDAC2 labeling intensity and mRNA synthesis in response to fluoxetine. In tandem, acetylated forms of histone H3 were found to be decreased. The effect was characterized in three serotonin projection areas, the caudate-putamen, the frontal cortex, and the dentate gyrus subregion of hippocampus. Our data highlight GABAergic neurons as major target cells expressing Mecp2 in response to the serotonin-elevating agents and suggest that serotonin signaling enhances gene silencing in postmitotic neurons.

Sixty‐four male Wistar rats were given free choice for 49 weeks between (1) water and MDMA solution, (2) water and THC solution or (3) water, MDMA solution and THC solution. After the first experiences with the drugs, animals of both monodrug and polydrug group developed an individually stable pattern of MDMA consumption, whereas the individual predictability of THC consumption remained poor. While THC consumption was maintained for the whole experimental period, MDMA consumption decreased with time and was nearly ceased after 3–7 months. Intake of both drugs was adapted to social changes, with THC consumption being more sensitive to social changes than MDMA consumption. In the re‐test after 4 months of abstinence, all animals ceased drug consumption when the drug solutions were adulterated with bitter tasting quinine. The results show that the rats had maintained a flexible mode of drug consumption and had not become addicted. Response to novelty of the rats in test trials before the start of drug supply correlated with later MDMA intake. In conclusion, although very low amounts of MDMA and/or THC were consumed, the findings that drug‐experienced animals responded differentially to a stressor and that housing conditions influenced drug intake suggests that MDMA and THC can induce psychopharmacological effects in our long‐term voluntary consumption paradigm.

AB  - The behavioral and neurobiological impact of cocaine can be strongly influenced by the environmental context in which the cocaine effects are experienced. In this report, we present the results of an experimental study in which the effects of environmental context in terms of novelty/familiarity upon locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine were examined. In the first phase of the study, two groups of naïve rats (N=10/group) received either cocaine (10 mg/kg) or saline immediately prior to a 20-min test in a novel open-field environment. After three daily cocaine/saline test sessions, both groups received a saline test to evaluate cocaine conditioned drug effects. In the second phase, two groups (N=10/group) were administered a 20-min saline test 1 day prior to receiving the same cocaine and saline testing regimen as in the first phase. Cocaine sensitization effects were not observed when the cocaine treatments were initiated in a novel environment but were observed when the same cocaine treatments were preceded 1 day by a single 20-min test environment exposure. The maximal locomotion sensitization effects observed, however, did not exceed the locomotor stimulant effects induced by cocaine administered in a novel environment. Thus, the cocaine sensitization manifested following a brief 20-min exposure to the test environment 1 day prior to cocaine administration represented a reversal of an inhibitory habituation effect. Cocaine-conditioned effects were also observed in both phases. These cocaine conditioned effects approximated, but did not exceed, the activation effects generated by a novel environment.

AB  - Cocaine induced psychosis (CIP) is a common, but not universal side effect of cocaine abuse. Factors underlying the development and severity of CIP remain poorly understood. This study tests the hypothesis that earlier age of initiation of regular use may increase the likelihood of developing CIP, or the severity of CIP symptoms.MethodsCocaine use history and severity of CIP (if any) were assessed with the Cocaine Experience Questionnaire in 51 abstinent (3 weeks–1 year) cocaine dependent individuals. Subjects were divided into those with high and low CIP severity, and into those with early age of initiation of regular cocaine use, and later age of initiation. Various cutoffs between early and late age of initiation were used, ranging from 15 to 22 years.ResultsFrom ages 17 through 20, controlling for cumulative duration of use, severity scores were significantly higher for the early initiation group than for the later initiation group (p values ranged from 0.031 to 0.036). Cumulative duration of use, but not age of initiation, significantly predicted initial development of CIP (p=0.044).ConclusionsThe data suggest that early age of initiation of regular cocaine use occurring during vulnerable periods of brain development, may lead to increased severity of CIP.

AB  - Administration of drugs of abuse can produce long-lasting effects on brain function, which involve modifications at neurotransmitter level as well as changes in proteins important for structural alterations of selected brain regions. The contribution of trophic factors in these events has so far been underestimated. Here, we demonstrate that a single cocaine injection selectively up-regulated fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) mRNA levels in the striatum and prefrontal cortex within 2 h, an effect that vanished by 24 h. However, prolonged exposure (5 or 14 days) to cocaine treatment produced an enduring elevation of FGF-2 mRNA levels that was evident 72 h after the last injection in the prefrontal cortex and could even persist for 14 days in the striatum, raising the possibility that cocaine treatment primes the brain, resulting in longer-lasting FGF-2 up-regulation in regions that are highly innervated by dopaminergic projections. The expression of FGF-2 was also significantly increased in the midbrain following acute or 5-day injection, suggesting that modulation of FGF-2 biosynthesis in dopamine-producing cells occurs only during early stages of cocaine exposure. Our results point to important mechanistic conclusions as to how cocaine alters FGF-2 expression. Whereas cocaine-induced changes in FGF-2 gene expression following a single injection could be ascribed to increased release of transmitters (mainly dopamine), enhanced FGF-2 gene expression following repeated administration identifies the trophic factor as part of the adaptive changes set in motion by cocaine.

AB  - The present study investigated the influence of trophic factors on the expression of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTp) in guinea-pig cardiac ganglia maintained in explant culture. In acutely isolated cardiac ganglia preparations, <1% of the cholinergic cardiac neurons exhibited CARTp immunoreactivity. In contrast, this number increased to >25% of the cardiac neurons after 72 h in explant culture. This increase in the number of CARTp neurons in cultured cardiac ganglia explants was accompanied by an increase in CARTp transcript levels as assessed by real time polymerase chain reaction. Treatment of cardiac ganglia cultures with neurturin or glial-derived trophic factor (both at 10 ng/ml) for 72 h prevented the increase in neurons that exhibited CARTp immunoreactivity. In contrast, treatment with ciliary neurotrophic factor (50 ng/ml) for 72 h produced a small significant increase in the percentage of CARTp-immunoreactive cardiac neurons and treatment with nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) had no effect. Neurturin treatment also decreased cardiac neuron CARTp levels after 72 h in explant culture. Cardiac neurons exhibited immunoreactivity to the neurturin receptor GFRα2 whereas non-neural cells preferentially exhibited immunoreactivity to the glial-derived neurotrophic factor receptor GFRα1 and neurturin transcripts were detected in cardiac tissue extracts. We hypothesize that a target-derived inhibitory factor, very likely neurturin, is a critical factor suppressing the expression of CARTp in guinea-pig cardiac neurons. These observations contrast with those reported in sympathetic neurons that suggest up-regulation of trophic factors after axotomy or during explant culture is a key factor contributing to the up-regulation of many neuropeptides.

AB  - Extracellular signal-regulated kinases and activator protein 1 transcription factor have been functionally linked to addiction. It has also been shown that extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation can regulate cocaine-induced expression of c-Fos and FosB, two possible components of activator protein 1. A direct link between extracellular signal-regulated kinases and activator protein 1 activation has, however, remained unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinases in the regulation of DNA-binding activity and composition of activator protein 1 induced in the mouse caudate putamen by cocaine treatment. We have found that pre-treatment with SL327, a selective inhibitor the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, has no influence on cocaine-induced DNA-binding activity of activator protein 1, when examined one hour after an acute cocaine treatment. This phenomenon results from simultaneous decrease of c-Fos protein level and increases in JunB and deltaFosB protein levels. SL327 pre-treatment, however, reduces the DNA-binding activity of the activator protein 1 complex induced six hours after an acute cocaine treatment as well as one hour after the last of the chronic cocaine injections, a phenomenon that results from the concomitant reduction of all cocaine-induced proteins (c-Fos, FosB, ΔFosB, JunB). In conclusion, we have found that extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition may not only interfere with cocaine-induced gene expression and activator protein 1 complex activation, but may also disturb the time-course of gene expression and composition of activator protein 1 complex. Our results support the notion that inhibitors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway could be valuable tools to obliterate cocaine-induced molecular changes and the development of addiction.

AB  - Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response is a form of reflex modification known to be sensitive to drugs and to subtle procedural manipulations. The present study examined the importance of prepulse length and prepulse-pulse interval in the expression of prepulse inhibition and its modification by the noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist, ketamine. In contrast to a previous report, ketamine disrupted prepulse inhibition at doses of 5.6 and 10 mg/kg when its short time course was taken into consideration. In a second experiment, the amount of prepulse inhibition was found to be directly related to prepulse length, with prepulse inhibition produced by shorter prepulse durations slightly more sensitive to disruption by ketamine. A third experiment examined prepulse-pulse time intervals (30–2000 ms). While prepulse inhibition produced by prepulses occurring 60–500 ms before the startle stimulus was disrupted by 10 mg/kg of ketamine, prepulses preceding the startle stimulus by only 30 ms produced either no effect or slight prepulse facilitation under control conditions, and significant prepulse facilitation when ketamine was administered. A fourth experiment examined the time course of prestimulus modification by continuous lead stimuli, ranging in onset from 15 to 75 ms before the startle stimulus. Prepulse facilitation, when observed, tended to occur in earlier portions of the session and was enhanced by ketamine. These results suggest that prestimulus modification of the startle reflex has important parametric and experiential determinants that may influence the effects of drugs. Some of these temporal determinants may have relevance to sensorimotor function in schizophrenia.

AB  - The role of genotype as a determinant of biologically based inter-individual differences in vulnerability to substance abuse has received little systematic investigation except in the case of alcohol. This report describes the use of an animal model, the inbred mouse, to identify and to characterize variants with inherently altered susceptibilities to the rewarding and other behavioral actions of their genetic diversity, genetic polymorphisc commonly occurred which altered the potency and/or efficacy of cocaine to induce conditioned place preference, oral self-administration, motor activity activation, seizures and lethality. These changes in cocaine sensitivity generally were of a behavior-specific and pharmacodynamic nature. One strain, DBA/2J, found to be markedly hyporesponsive to the rewarding action of cocaine, also was hyporesonsive to the rewarding effects of amphetamine, etonitazene, phencyclidine, caffeine and procaine. We speculate that this strain has an inherent generalized appetitive defect. The frequent occurence and large magnitude of inherent phenotypic changes in cocaine responsiveness which we have identified phenotypic changes in cocaine responsiveness which we have identified among inbred mouse strains now permits an analytical genetic study of prcoesses underlying cocaine-mediated reinforcement.

AB  - To study determinants and possible reasons of cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization, locomotor effects of the drug (COC, 15 mg/kg, IP; 5 daily injections followed by a "challenge," four days later) and various stimuli associated (procedure of injection, placement in the test cage) and nonassociated (tail-pinch) with its administration were measured in rats under different experimental conditions. When COC was injected in quiet conditions, two hours after animal habituation to the test cages, locomotor response to the first drug injection was only slightly higher compared to one of saline and these responses were relatively stable following repeated treatment (no sensitization). An enhanced locomotor response to the procedure of injection (needle prick) without changes in responsivity to other stimuli used were found in these COC-treated rats. When COC was injected in activated conditions (animal placement in test cages), locomotor response to the first drug administration was significantly higher compared to one of saline and COC used in the quiet state and it was enhanced following repeated treatment (sensitization). More intense locomotion associated with placement in test cages without any changes in responses to other stimuli was found in rats after this procedure of treatment. Thus, locomotor effects of COC and dynamics of its changes following repeated treatment depend upon the organism's functional state accompanying the drug's effect. Reinforcing action of COC determining development of interin-fluence of its effects and ones triggered by environmental variables (learning based on conditioning) is considered as a proposed initial cause and a main mechanism both for enhanced reactivity to cocaine administered under conditions of its previous use and to various environmental events associated with previous cocaine effects.

AB  - Cocaine is a widely used drug of abuse and psychostimulant that acts on the central nervous system by blocking the dopamine reuptake sites. PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma clonal line, in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), multiply and differentiate into competent neurons that can synthesize, store, and secrete the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA). In the present study, we evaluated the effect of increasing doses of cocaine on the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs), c-fosand c-jun, and closely related transcription factors, SP-1 and NF-k, at 24 h after the exposure to cocaine (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2500 M) in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Cocaine (50-500 M) resulted in significant induction of the expression of c-fos, c-jun, SP-1, and NF-k. However, higher concentrations of cocaine (1000 and 2500 M) resulted in the downregulation of these expressions after 24 h. To further understand the role of dose-dependent changes in the mechanisms of cell death, we evaluated the protein expression of apoptotic markers. A concentration-dependent increase in the expression of caspase-9 and -3 was observed up to 500 M cocaine. However, the higher dose did not show any expression. We also evaluated the effect of increasing doses of cocaine on DA concentration and the expression of dopamine transporter (DAT). A significant dose-dependent decrease in the concentration of DA as well as the expression of DAT was observed 24 h after the exposure of PC12 cells to cocaine. Therefore, in the present study, we reported that cocaine has both upstream and downstream regulatory actions on some IEGs and transcription factors that can regulate the mechanism of cell death, and these effects on gene expression are independent of its action on the dopaminergic system.

AB  - Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a neuropeptide associated with the integration of the physiological and behavioral responses to stress. Recently, CRF1 receptor antagonists have been shown to decrease cocaine self-administration and inhibit stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. The exact mechanisms underlying this effect are not clear. Based on the large amount of literature demonstrating an association between dopaminergic neurotransmission and reward-related behavior, the aim of the present study was to examine the effects of acute versus chronic CRF1 receptor blockade on mesencephalic dopamine (DA) neuron activity (determined by in vivo extracellular recordings) and extracellular DA levels in the nucleus accumbens (Acb) (using in vivo microdialysis). In addition, the effect of CRF1 receptor antagonism on cocaine-induced DA overflow in the Acb was examined and correlated with DA neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Acute (but not chronic) CRF1 receptor blockade by CRA-0450 [1-[8-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-methylquinolin-4-yl]-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-carboxamide benzenesulfonate] was found to significantly increase DA neuron population activity without affecting burst firing, average firing rate, or Acb DA levels. In addition, both acute and chronic CRF1 receptor antagonism significantly reduced cocaine-stimulated DA overflow in the Acb, and this reduction was correlated with an attenuated cocaine-induced inhibition of DA population activity. Taken as a whole, these data demonstrate that, although DA neuron population activity exhibits tolerance to chronic CRF1 receptor antagonism (by CRA-0450), tolerance does not develop to the selective inhibition of cocaine-induced DA release (in the Acb) and, as such, may be beneficial in the treatment of cocaine addiction.

AB  - The neurotrophic factor glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) may have therapeutic potential for preventing and treating cocaine addiction. Previously, we found that transplantation of a GDNF-expressing astrocyte cell line into the striatum and nucleus accumbens attenuates cocaine-seeking behavior in Sprague–Dawley rats. However, as a potential treatment for humans, cell transplantation presents several technical and ethical complications. Nanoparticulate systems are a safe and effective method for introducing exogenous compounds into the brain. Therefore, we examined the effect of GDNF-conjugated nanoparticles microinjected into the striatum and nucleus accumbens on cocaine self-administration in rats. GDNF-conjugated nanoparticles blocked the acquisition of cocaine self-administration compared to control treatments. Furthermore, a cocaine dose response demonstrated that decreased lever response in rats that received GDNF-conjugated nanoparticles persisted after substitution with different cocaine doses. This effect is not due to a non-specific disruption of locomotor or operant behavior, as seen following a water operant task. The current study is one of the first demonstrations that drug-conjugated nanoparticles may be effective in treating brain disorders. These findings suggest that GDNF-conjugated nanoparticles may serve as a novel potential treatment for drug addiction.

AB  - Ketamine is widely used in equine anaesthesia. Beside its anaesthetic and analgesic properties, ketamine possesses a cytokine-modulating activity. However, to date, no data are available regarding the inhibitory effect of ketamine on the cytokine response in horses. In horses, cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-<formula notation="TeX">$\alpha$</formula>) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of equine endotoxaemia following gastrointestinal disorders. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the influence of ketamine on LPS-induced TNF-<formula notation="TeX">$\alpha$</formula> and IL-6 formation in an equine macrophage cell line (eCAS cells). The results demonstrate a cytokine-modulating activity of ketamine in an equine cell line, suggesting a beneficial role for ketamine in the treatment of equine endotoxaemia.

AB  - Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a highly expressed hypothalamic transcript that is concentrated in areas associated with the stress response. There is evidence for a role of CART in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, it is not clear whether CART regulates activity of the HPA axis by directly stimulating ACTH release from pituitary corticotropes or through interaction with hypothalamic factors. To address this issue, the effects of central and peripheral administration of CART on the HPA axis were compared. Central administration of CART(55–102) (1 μg) significantly increased circulating levels of ACTH (481 ± 122 vs.93 ± 14 pg/ml; CART vs.vehicle) and corticosterone (460 ± 29 vs.179 ± 62 ng/ml; CART vs.vehicle). In contrast, iv injection of CART(55–102) (0.09-9.0 nmol/kg) did not significantly affect circulating levels of ACTH or corticosterone. The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor antagonist Astressin B was used to determine whether CART(55–102) elicits ACTH secretion via a CRF receptor-dependent mechanism. Injection of Astressin B (50 μg/kg, iv) inhibited CART(55–102)-induced ACTH and corticosterone responses. The effects of CART(55–102) on CRF and arginine vasopressin (AVP) expression were also examined in static hypothalamic explants. RT-PCR analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of CRF and AVP mRNA levels after CART(55–102) (10 nmand 1 μm) treatment. Last, the effects of CART(55–102) on CRF- and AVP-mediated ACTH release was investigated in dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells. Incubation of CART(55–102) (10–100 nm) did not significantly affect ACTH release from anterior pituitary cells. Findings from the present study suggest that CART regulates activity of the HPA axis through a CRF-dependent central mechanism and not by means of direct interaction with pituitary corticotropes.

AB  - Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its structurally related proteins are involved in the developmental regulation of various brain neurons, including midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We recently reported EGF and EGF-receptor abnormalities in both the brain tissues and blood of schizophrenic patients. Administration of EGF to neonatal rats transiently increases tyrosine hydroxylase expression and subsequently results in behavioral abnormalities in prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle, locomotor activity, and social interaction after development. The enhanced locomotor and stereotypic responses of the neonatally EGF-treated rats are considered to be an animal model for positive schizophrenia symptoms. In the present study, we investigated psychostimulant sensitivity of neonatally EGF-treated rats. At the adult stage, EGF-treated rats were challenged with cocaine (15 mgkg) or methamphetamine (1 mgkg), and conditioned place preference and locomotor activity were examined. The rats that received EGF during the neonatal period had significantly higher conditioned place preference for where cocaine or methamphetamine was administered than controls. The neonatal EGF treatment enhanced behavioral response to methamphetamine and behavioral sensitization to cocaine at the adult stage. Drug-naive controls gradually increased locomotor responses to cocaine during their daily injections, whereas EGF-treated rats exhibited a larger increase in cocaine responses. These results indicate that overactivation of the EGF receptors (ErbB1) during the neonatal period influences future sensitivity to psychostimulants. Our findings indicate a potential link between EGF-receptor activation and drug addiction.

AB  - Among cocaine addicts, there is a strong variation in response to relapse provoking factors like conditioned cues and renewed contact with the drug. Here we show that such large individual differences also exist in rats. Reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior was triggered by contingent presentation of a cocaine-conditioned cue or an amphetamine priming injection. We found no positive correlation between cue- and drug-controlled reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Rather, a slight, but significant negative correlation was observed, which was particularly evident in two subgroups of rats that responded highest following either amphetamine priming or cue presentation. A large middle group responded equally for both relapse provoking factors. Further, cocaine-seeking behavior during the first extinction session correlated positively with cue-induced reinstatement. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that the therapeutic efficacy of relapse prevention strategies may depend on individual sensitivity to distinct relapse provoking stimuli.

AB  - The pregnant rats received daily sc injections of cocaine (30 mg/kg) or saline from the gestational day (GD) 7 to GD 20. At 1 week postnatal, all pups were killed and the hippocampus, cortex and striatum were dissected out. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) under the basal condition and depolarization with high potassium (40 mM) were measured. The results showed that hippocampal BDNF levels under basal and depolarization conditions were all significantly lower in the pups prenatally exposed to cocaine than those exposed to saline. There were no significant differences in basal BDNF levels between the cocaine and saline groups in the cortex or striatum. However, the prenatally cocaine-treated pups showed significantly less BDNF release following high potassium depolarization than the saline-treated animals did in both these regions. The results support the suggestion that prenatal cocaine exposure decreases BDNF expression in the offspring.

AB  - The influence of the genetic deletion polymorphism of glutathione S -transferase μ 1 ( GSTM1 0 / 0 ) on levels of anti (±)-r-7,t-8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ( anti -BPDE-DNA) adduct in the peripheral blood lymphocyte plus monocyte fraction (LMF) of coke-oven workers was investigated. A total of 95 male Polish coke-oven workers (60% current smokers) from two different plants comprised the sample population. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) exposure was assessed by means of the individual post-shift urinary excretion of 1-pyrenol ( mean ± S . D . : 6.93±7.20 μmol/mol creatinine; 70% of the subjects exceeded the proposed biological exposure index (BEI) 2.28 μmol/mol creatinine). Anti -BPDE-DNA adduct levels were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/fluorescence analysis of the anti -BPDE tetrol I-1 released after acid hydrolysis of DNA samples. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the genomic DNA of each subject. Coke-oven workers without active GSTM1 ( GSTM1 0 / 0 , 33%) had significantly higher adduct levels than those with active GSTM1 ( GSTM1 1 / 1 and 1 / 0 ) ( 5.90±5.59 versus 3.25±2.01 adducts/10 bases, Mann-Whitney U -test, z=2.53 , P=0.011 ), PAH exposure in the two subgroups being similar ( 7.06±6.83 versus 6.67±8.00 1-pyrenol μmol/mol creatinine). The highest number of GSTM1 null subjects (12/23, 39%) belonged to the quartile with the highest adduct levels (i.e., >4.67 adducts/10 nucleotides). That is, coke-oven workers with GSTM1 0 / 0 genotype had a significantly higher risk of having high adduct levels than individuals with active GSTM1 genotype (Fisher exact test P=0.0355 ; odds ratio ( OR )=4.145 , 95% CI 1.0-18.8). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the increase in anti -BPDE-DNA adduct levels in LMF was significantly related to the high occupational exposure to PAHs (benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)) of coke-oven workers ( t=3.087 , P&lt;0.01 ) and to the lack of GSTM1 activity ( t=3.512 , P&lt;0.001 ), rather than to the two other confounding factors of PAH intake, i.e. charcoal-broiled meat consumption and smoking habits. In conclusion, our results indicate the clear influence of the GSTM1 detoxifying genotype on anti -BPDE-DNA adduct formation in the LMF of coke-oven workers. This is invaluable for future environmental-occupational studies using this biomarker of PAH exposure.

AB  - During development, survival of midbrain dopamine neurons and specification of their phenotype are dependent upon the intracellular expression of a number of transcription factors, including Engrailed 1, Pitx3, and Nurr1. The role of these transcription factors in the maintenance of the dopaminergic phenotype is less clear. In the present study, we show that each of these transcription factors is robustly expressed in adult dopamine neurons in human midbrain, and that cocaine abuse is associated with a significant decrease in the abundance of Nurr1 and Pitx3 in these cells. These data suggest that cocaine abuse leads to a partial loss of dopaminergic phenotype.

AB  - This cross-sectional survey investigates the frequency of adverse cocaine reactions and associated factors among regular cocaine misusers. A sample of 332 cocaine misusers from a range of treatment and nontreatment settings in Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, were interviewed using a questionnaire that includes the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), the CAGE, and an eight-item questionnaire investigating the frequency of specific adverse cocaine reactions. The most commonly described reactions were hot flushes (84%), uncontrollable shaking (76%), and feeling ill (75%). The most severe symptoms and least common were convulsions or fits (18%) and passing out (21%). Frequency of adverse reactions to cocaine was positively associated with out-of-treatment status, severity of cocaine dependence, ever having injected cocaine, using tranquilisers with cocaine, and GHQ score. Adverse reactions to cocaine are common among regular cocaine users. Some of the adverse effects, especially those on the heart and central nervous system, are potentially fatal. Preventive strategies should be developed to reduce the risk of adverse cocaine reactions. The findings are discussed in relation to the type of interventions that might be developed and lines of future research.

AB  - Growing concerns surround the risk of fetal exposure to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy). Prior animal studies using neonatal rats administered MDMA from postnatal days (P) 11-20 (a period approximating third trimester brain development in humans) have demonstrated long-lasting decrements in serotonin (5-HT) and learning; however, no studies have examined the acute post-MDMA response of the brain at this early age. Specifically, it is of interest whether MDMA administration to neonatal rats produces the expected depletion of monoamines and whether the brain exhibits any ameliorative response to the pharmacologic insult. In the current study, this model was employed to determine whether forebrain and brainstem dopamine (DA) and 5-HT neurochemistry were altered 24 h after the last injection (P21), and whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was upregulated in response to MDMA exposure. All forebrain structures examined (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum) showed significant MDMA-induced reductions in 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-HIAA, and significant increases in the DA metabolite, HVA, as well as DA turnover (HVA/DA). In the brainstem, there were significant increases in 5-HIAA, HVA and DA turnover. BDNF was significantly increased (19-38%) in all forebrain structures and in the brainstem in MDMA-exposed neonates versus saline controls. These data suggest that MDMA exposure to the developing rat brain from P11-20 produces similar alterations in serotonin and dopamine neurochemistry to those observed from adult administrations. In addition, a compensatory increase in BDNF was observed and may be the brains ameliorative response to minimize MDMA effects. This is the first report demonstrating that MDMA exposure results in increased levels of BDNF and that such increases are correlated with changes in monoamine levels. Future research is needed to elucidate any deleterious effects MDMA-induced increases in trophic activity might have on the developing brain and to examine earlier gestational exposure periods in order to assess the risk throughout pregnancy.

AB  - RationaleThere is considerable evidence that the stress-related neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), plays an important role in mediating behavioural changes induced by prior experience with cocaine. From this perspective, it is conceivable that repeated exposure to cocaine induces a form of sensitization in CRF systems that makes animals more responsive to CRF following prolonged drug-free periods.ObjectivesTo study the effects of repeated cocaine exposure on locomotor activity induced by different doses of CRF after drug-free periods ranging from 24 h to 28 days.MethodsMale Wistar rats were injected once daily for 7 days with cocaine (15 mg/kg, IP on days 1 and 7 in locomotor chambers; 30 mg/kg, IP, on days 2–6 in home cages) or saline. In experiment 1, starting 10 days after the last injection, animals were tested for their locomotor response to intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of vehicle and three doses of CRF (0.25, 0.5, and 5 µg). In experiment 2, animals were tested for their locomotor response to ICV injections of 0.5 µg CRF after drug-free periods of 1–2, 10–11 and 28–29 days.ResultsCompared to saline pre-exposed animals, cocaine pre-exposed animals showed a significantly greater locomotor response to CRF, relative to vehicle, at all doses tested (experiment 1) and after drug-free periods of up to 28 days (experiment 2). The effects were clear and extremely consistent in magnitude between experiments and conditions.ConclusionsThese results suggest that cocaine pre-exposure induces long-term changes in the responsivity of the central nervous system to CRF.

AB  - The long-term effect of cocaine self-administration on corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) mRNA content in the hypothalamic CRF-containing neurons has not yet been established. The purpose of this study was to examine the time course effects of the extinction of cocaine self-administration behavior on CRF gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) using in situ hybridization histochemistry (IHHS). Seventy-two littermate male Lewis rats were randomly assigned in triads to one of three conditions: (a) contingent intravenous self-administration of 1 mg/kg/injection of cocaine (CONT), (b) non-contingent injections of either 1 mg/kg/injection of cocaine (NONCONT) or (c) saline yoked (SALINE) to the intake of the self-administering subject. The self-administering rats were trained to self-administer cocaine under a fixed ratio 5 (FR5) schedule of reinforcement for a minimum of 3 weeks. After stable baseline levels of drug intake had been reached, saline was substituted for drug. Following this first extinction period, cocaine self-administration was reinstated for an additional period of 2 weeks. Immediately after cessation of the last session of cocaine self-administration (Day 0) and 1, 5 and 10 days after the second extinction period, animal brains in each triad were removed to be processed for IHHS. CRF mRNA levels in the PVN were significantly lower in the NONCONT cocaine group at Day 0 compared to CONT or SALINE groups. On Day 1, hypothalamic CRF gene expression significantly decreased in the CONT cocaine group with respect to the SALINE group, but there were no differences between the cocaine groups or among the NONCONT cocaine and SALINE groups. After 5 and 10 days of extinction, no differences were found in CRF mRNA content in the PVN between the three conditions of this study. These results suggest that, after the extinction of cocaine self-administration, changes in hypothalamic CRF gene expression are differentially affected depending upon the type of cocaine administration, and that the stages of cocaine withdrawal might not be associated with enduring changes in hypothalamic CRF mRNA levels.

AB  - Neurotrophic factors, such as glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), may play a role in drug‐induced biochemical and behavioural adaptations that characterize addiction. We found that GDNF mRNA levels are lower in the striatum of rats that chronically self‐administered cocaine. Therefore, we examined the effect of transplanted cells used as a biodelivery system for GDNF on cocaine self‐administration in rats. A human astrocyte‐like cell line, which produces and excretes GDNF, was transplanted into the striatum and nucleus accumbens of rats. These rats showed a significantly lower number of active lever presses in the cocaine self‐administration paradigm compared with control rats. Moreover, rats that received a chronic infusion of GDNF via a micro‐osmotic pump also exhibited weak cocaine self‐administration. Therefore, we conclude that exogenous augmentation of GDNF repositories may be useful in suppressing cocaine self‐administration.

AB  - Neurotrophic factors, such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), may play a role in drug-induced biochemical and behavioural adaptations that characterize addiction. We found that GDNF mRNA levels are lower in the striatum of rats that chronically self-administered cocaine. Therefore, we examined the effect of transplanted cells used as a biodelivery system for GDNF on cocaine self-administration in rats. A human astrocyte-like cell line, which produces and excretes GDNF, was transplanted into the striatum and nucleus accumbens of rats. These rats showed a significantly lower number of active lever presses in the cocaine self-administration paradigm compared with control rats. Moreover, rats that received a chronic infusion of GDNF via a micro-osmotic pump also exhibited weak cocaine self-administration.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) affects the development of brain neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine and serotonin systems that are important for cocaine's rewarding and locomotor stimulatory properties. Human genomic markers within or near the BDNF locus have been linked to or associated with substance abuse. Post-mortem human brain specimens reveal individual differences in the levels of BDNF mRNA and in mRNA splicing patterns. To assess the effects of lifelong alterations in the levels of BDNF expression on a measure of psychostimulant reward, we have compared locomotor stimulant and rewarding effects of cocaine in heterozygous BDNF knockout mice with effects in their wild-type littermates. Heterozygous BDNF knockout mice displayed less locomotion during habituation and less locomotion after cocaine injections. Cocaine-conditioned place preferences were reduced in the BDNF heterozygotes. These mice displayed no significant difference from saline control values at a dose of 10 mg/kg s.c. cocaine, although they exhibited cocaine-induced preference at a 20 mg/kg dose. These data confirm important roles for BDNF in psychostimulant actions, presumably via neurotrophic effects on dopamine and serotonin systems. Furthermore, these data support suggestions that differences in human BDNF expression may underlie associations between markers near the human BDNF gene locus and drug addiction.

AB  - The endogenous nature of the drug of abuse gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) has caused various interpretative problems for toxicologists. In order to obtain data for the presence of endogenous GHB in humans and to investigate any factors that may affect this, a volunteer study was undertaken. The GHB concentrations in 119 urine specimens from GHB-free subjects and 25 urine specimens submitted for toxicological analysis showed maximal urinary GHB concentrations of 3mg/l. Analysis of 15 plasma specimens submitted for toxicological analysis detected no measurable GHB (less than 2.5mg/l). Studies in a male and female volunteer in which different dietary food groups were ingested at weekly intervals, showed significant creatinine-independent intra-individual fluctuation with overall urine GHB concentrations between 0 and 2.55, and 0 and 2.74mg/l, respectively. Urinary concentrations did not appear to be affected by the particular dietary groups studied.The concentrations measured by gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC–FID) and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) lend further support to the proposed urinary and plasma interpretative cut-offs of 10 and 4mg/l, respectively, where below this it is not possible to determine whether any GHB detected is endogenous or exogenous in nature.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data on use and misuse of six classes of illicit substances by male twin pairs were used to examine whether genetic and shared environmental risk factors for substance use disorders are substance-specific or -nonspecific in their effect. METHOD: Lifetime history of use and abusedependence of cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, sedatives, stimulants, and opiates was assessed at personal interview in both members of 1,196 male-male twin pairs ascertained by the Virginia Twin Registry. Multivariate twin modeling of substance-nonspecific (common) and substance-specific genetic, shared environmental, and unique environmental risk factors was performed by using the program Mx. RESULTS: High levels of comorbidity involving the different substance categories were observed for both use and abusedependence. One common genetic factor was found to have a strong influence on risk for illicit use and abusedependence for all six substance classes. A modest influence of substance-specific genetic factors was seen for use but not for abusedependence. Shared environmental factors were more important for use than for abusedependence and were mediated entirely through a single common factor. CONCLUSIONS: In an adult population-based sample of male twins, both the genetic and the shared environmental effects on risk for the use and misuse of six classes of illicit substances were largely or entirely nonspecific in their effect. Environmental experiences unique to the person largely determine whether predisposed individuals will use or misuse one class of psychoactive substances rather than another.

AB  - The effects on locomotor response to cocaine challenge, acquisition of cocaine conditioned place preference and cocaine-induced dopamine (DA) release in nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area by the non-specific corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors antagonist α-helical CRF, the selective CRF receptor subtype 1 antagonist CP-154,526 and the selective CRF receptor subtype 2 antagonist anti-sauvagine-30 (AS-30) were investigated in rats. Both α-helical CRF (10 µg, i.c.v.) and CP-154,526 (3 µg, i.c.v.) decreased the cocaine-induced distance travelled, whereas AS-30 (3 µg, i.c.v.) did not show such an effect. The CRF receptor antagonists also have significant effects on stereotype counts induced by cocaine injection, in which the α-helical CRF or CP-154,526 but not AS-30 did significantly reduce the stereotype counts. α-Helical CRF (10 µg) prior to each injection of cocaine blocked cocaine conditioned place preference with no significant difference observed in the time spent in the drug-paired side between post- and pre-training and both 1 and 3 µg CP-154,526 also had significant inhibitory effects on cocaine-induced place preference. However, pre-treatment with an i.c.v. infusion of AS-30 (1 or 3 µg) prior to each injection of cocaine did not affect the acquisition of conditioned place preference. The α-helical CRF and CP-154,526 reduced extracellular DA levels of nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area in response to the injection of cocaine. However, both α-helical CRF and CP-154,526 did not modify extracellular DA levels under basal conditions. In contrast, the i.c.v. infusion of AS-30 had no effects on either the basal DA or the cocaine-induced increase in DA release in nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. These findings demonstrate that activation of the CRF receptor is involved in behavioral and neurochemical effects of cocaine challenge and cocaine reward and that the role of CRF receptor subtypes 1 and 2 in cocaine-induced locomotion, reward and DA release is not identical. The CRF receptor subtype 1 is largely responsible for the action of the CRF system on cocaine locomotion and reward. These results suggest that the CRF receptor antagonist, particularly the CRF receptor subtype 1 antagonist, might be of some value in the treatment of cocaine addiction and cocaine-related behavioral disorders.

AB  - In our previous work, 10 Wh-class (30650 type) lithium secondary batteries, which were fabricated with LiNi 0.7 Co 0.3 O 2 positive electrodes and graphite-coke hybrid carbon negative electrodes, showed an excellent cycle performance of 2350 cycles at a 70% state of charge charge-discharge cycle test. However, this cycle performance is insufficient for dispersed energy storage systems, such as home use load leveling systems. In order to clarify the capacity fade factors of the cell, we focused our investigation on the ability discharge capacity of the positive and negative electrodes after 2350 cycles. Although the cell capacity deteriorated to 70% of its initial capacity after 2350 cycles, it was confirmed that the LiNi 0.7 Co 0.3 O 2 positive electrode and graphite-coke hybrid negative electrode after 2350 cycles still have sufficient ability discharge capacity of 86 and 92% of their initial capacity, respectively. Accompanied by the result for a composition analysis of the positive electrode material by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), electrochemical active lithium decreased and the Li x Ni 0.7 Co 0.3 O 2 positive electrode could be charged-discharged in a narrow range of between x =0.41 and 0.66 in the battery, although it had enough ability discharge capacity that can use between x =0.36 and 0.87. It is predicted that solid electrolyte interface formation by electrolyte decomposition on the carbon negative electrode during the charge-discharge cycle test is a main factor of the decrease of electrochemical active lithium.

AB  - Chronic exposure to cocaine induces long-term adaptations that are likely to involve changes in transcription factor expression. This possibility has not been examined in the cocaine-exposed human brain. The transcription factor nurr1 is highly expressed in rodent midbrain dopamine neurons and is essential for their proper phenotypic development. Here we show that human NURR1 gene expression is robust within control subjects and reduced markedly within the dopamine neurons of human cocaine abusers. NURR1 is known to regulate transcription of the gene encoding the cocaine-sensitive dopamine transporter (DAT). We show here that DAT gene expression also is reduced markedly in the dopamine neurons of NURR1-deficient cocaine abusers, suggesting that NURR1 plays a critical role in vivo in controlling human DAT gene expression and adaptation to repeated exposure to cocaine.

AB  - Subjects for this study were 1,478 community-recruited women sexual partners of male injection drug users who were participants in the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-supported Women Helping to Empower and Enhance Lives (WHEEL) project. This study assessed the association between childadolescent sexual abuse—including specific type of abuse and perpetrator of abuse—and lifetime crack use in this sample of women. About 64% of sample women had ever used crack; 56% had been sexually abused by age 18. In logistic regression analyses, any sexual abuse in childhood, penetrative sexual abuse in childhood, and sexual abuse by a family member in childhood were significantly associated with lifetime crack use. Sexual abuse in adolescence was indirectly associated with lifetime crack use through running away from home and rape in adulthood. Given that many of these subjects reported drug treatment experience, such programs may provide the best setting for helping women with both substance use and sexual abuse issues.

AB  - Relapse to drug use following prolonged periods of abstinence results, in part, from the ability of contextual cues paired previously with self-administered drug to elicit drug craving and -seeking behavior. Given the popularity of the mouse for the genetic analysis of drug-induced behaviors, a place conditioning model of drug-seeking behavior was used to examine the ability of cocaine (COC) to reinstate extinguished conditioned reward in mice. In a series of experiments, COC place conditioning was produced in male C57BL/6 (B6) mice by four pairings of COC (15 or 25 mg/kg, IP) with the non-preferred compartment of a two-compartment place conditioning apparatus. Following a post-conditioning test (Post-Test), place conditioning was extinguished by repeated testing. The mice were then challenged with one of five COC doses (0, 5, 10, 15 or 25 mg/kg, IP) and allowed free access to both environments. Following extinction, COC injections reinstated place conditioning to 100% or greater, relative to the Post-Test. In a control experiment, mice received either COC or SAL paired with non-preferred compartment and were then challenged with either COC (15 mg/kg, IP) or SAL on the Post-Test. COC-conditioned, but not SAL-conditioned, mice exhibited place conditioning when tested in a COC-free state. Interestingly, COC injection on the Post-Test elicited an increase in approach behavior in both SAL- and COC-conditioned mice and this increase was equivalent to that produced by COC conditioning alone. No direct relationships were observed between the magnitude of place conditioning and either COC-induced or -conditioned locomotor hyperactivity in the non-preferred compartment. Thus, at least two independent processes appear to underlie the ability of a COC injection to elicit approach behavior towards the non-preferred compartment of a biased place conditioning apparatus in mice--reactivation of the conditioned incentive motivational properties of COC-paired cues and elicitation of unconditioned behavioral disinhibition. One or both of these processes sensitizes with the passage of time, increasing the propensity of B6 mice to approach non-preferred environments upon COC re-administration.

AB  - Abstract. Rationale: Increasing concomitant abuse of cocaine and morphine-like opioids has prompted a number of studies aimed at understanding how these drugs interact. Objective: The present study was designed to determine if variations in opioid pretreatment time would affect how µ opioid agonists interact with cocaine. Methods: Rats were trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg cocaine from saline. One group of subjects (n=6) received morphine (5.6 mg/kg) 0.5 h, 1 h or 4 h prior to cumulative doses of cocaine (0.1-17.8 mg/kg). These pretreatment times were selected to overlap with states of acute opioid tolerance (~1 h) or acute opioid dependence (~4 h) as demonstrated by previous studies. A second group (n=6) was administered naloxone (0.3 mg/kg) 5 min prior to cumulative cocaine doses, with or without a 4-h morphine (5.6 mg/kg) or methadone (3.0 mg/kg) pretreatment. In a third procedure, the same subjects used in the second experiment were also tested for time-dependent changes in the analgesic effect of morphine using a hot-plate assay. Results: Morphine pretreatment 1 h prior to assessment of the cocaine dose-response function significantly enhanced the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine. However, neither 0.5-h or 4-h morphine pretreatment had any effect. In contrast, when naloxone was administered 4 h following either morphine or methadone and 5 min prior to assessment of the cocaine dose-response curve, the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine were significantly attenuated. In assessing morphine-induced analgesia, paw-lick latency was significantly longer at 1 h and shorter at 4 h following morphine administration. Conclusions: The results illustrate the importance of temporal parameters for interactions between cocaine and µ opioid agonists.

AB  - ΔFosB is a Fos family transcription factor that is induced by chronic exposure to cocaine and other drugs of abuse in the nucleus accumbens and related striatal regions, brain regions that are important for the behavioral effects of these drugs. To better understand the mechanisms by which ΔFosB contributes to the effects of chronic drug treatment, we used DNA microarray analysis to identify genes that are regulated in the nucleus accumbens upon ΔFosB expression in inducible bitransgenic mice. One of the most highly regulated genes was that encoding a subunit of another transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Subsequent experiments confirmed the induction of NF-κB in the nucleus accumbens of mice overexpressing ΔFosB as well as in wild-type mice treated chronically, but not acutely, with cocaine. These results establish NF-κB as a putative target for ΔFosB and implicate NF-κB signaling pathways in the long-term adaptations of nucleus accumbens neurons to cocaine.

TI  - Is hyperthermia the triggering factor for hepatotoxicity induced by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy)? An in vitro study using freshly isolated mouse hepatocytes

AB  - The consumption of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy; MDMA) may cause hepatocellular damage in humans, a toxic effect that has been increasing in frequency in the last few years, although the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. The metabolism of MDMA involves the production of reactive metabolites which form adducts with intracellular nucleophilic sites, as is the case with glutathione (GSH). Also, MDMA administration elicits hyperthermia, a potentially deleterious condition that may aggravate its direct toxic effects. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the extent of MDMA-induced depletion of GSH, induction of lipid peroxidation and loss of cell viability in freshly isolated mouse hepatocytes under normothermic conditions (37°C) and to compare the results with the effects obtained under hyperthermic conditions (41°C). By itself, hyperthermia was an important cause of cell toxicity. A rise in incubation temperature from 37°C to 41°C caused oxidative stress in freshly isolated mouse hepatocytes, reflected as a time-dependent induction of lipid peroxidation and consequent loss of cell viability (up to 40-45%), although the variations in GSH and GSSG levels were similar to those under normothermic conditions. MDMA (100, 200, 400, 800 and 1600 µM) induced a concentration- and time-dependent GSH depletion at 37°C but had a negligible effect on lipid peroxidation and cell viability at this temperature. It is particularly noteworthy that hyperthermia (41°C) potentiated MDMA-induced depletion of GSH, production of lipid peroxidation and loss of cell viability (up to 90-100%). It is therefore concluded that hyperthermia potentiates MDMA-induced toxicity in freshly isolated mouse hepatocytes.

AB  - Aims.To examine the relationship between various interpersonal, intrapersonal and situational factors assessed at 6, 12 and 18 months after entrance to continuing care, and cocaine use in subsequent periods. Design.A randomized clinical trial with a 2‐year follow‐up. Setting. An outpatient US Veterans Administration substance abuse treatment program. Participants.Cocaine‐dependent male veterans (N = 132) entering continuing care. Interventions.12‐Step focused group treatment vs. individualized relapse prevention continuing care. Measurements.Motivation, coping and mood, social support, co‐morbid problem severity, treatment attendance, self‐help participation and cocaine use variables were assessed at each follow‐up. Findings.During the 2‐year follow‐up, patients used cocaine on fewer than 8% of the days in each of the four 6‐month periods, which represented a highly significant decrease in relation to cocaine use prior to treatment. In univariate analyses, abstinence commitment, self‐efficacy, positive mood, support from family, employment, attendance in continuing care and self‐help participation at two or more of the follow‐ups predicted less cocaine use in subsequent 6‐month periods. Readiness to change and medical, psychiatric, legal and family/social problem severities either did not predict, or were inconsistently related to, subsequent cocaine use. In multivariate analyses, degree of self‐help participation emerged as the strongest and most consistent predictor of cocaine use. However, when current cocaine use at each follow‐up was controlled, none of the predictors was significant at more than one follow‐up point. There was little evidence of interactions between treatment condition and the predictor variables. Conclusions.Continued self‐help participation and the early achievement of cocaine abstinence appear to be important factors in the maintenance of good cocaine use outcomes over extended periods. The results also highlight the importance of controlling for various post‐treatment factors when evaluating the relationship between any one factor and subsequent outcome, as many of the factors that were significant predictors in the univariate analyses were no longer significant when other factors were controlled.

AB  - This descriptive study presents a method of identifying factors associated with a non-problematic level of functioning with lOnon-treatment cocaine users. A subjective assessment of an acceptable level of functioning was verified by the Addiction Severity Index (AS!) screening instrument (Mclellan et aI., 1992). Findings indicated that non-problematic, non-treatment cocaine users are from diverse social classes, have social and economic concerns comparable to the general population, and share similar values with the general population. In contrast to the substance use or abuse treatment approach of total abstinence, a continuum model is presented ranging from non-problematic to highly problematic use. Implications for rehabilitation counselors include awareness of the continuum model, familiarity with the ASI use as a brief screening measure in counseling, and enhancing non-problematic substance users' self-efficacy in safely controlling their substance use.

AB  - ABSTRACTA positive relationship between cocaine use and violence is assumed in American social and political discourse. We examined that relationship with data on arrestees in 23 urban areas from the NIJ Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program. Logistic regression revealed that cocaine use actually decreases the probability of a violent arrest. This negative relationship held across gender and race lines, net of the effects of individual demographic characteristics and criminal history. While the strength of the relationship did not differ across race, a significantly stronger relationship between cocaine use and non-violent arrest was observed for female arrestees. Our findings substantiate a link between cocaine use and nonviolent economic crime.

AB  - Recent study has indicated that cocaine-amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is an anorectic chemical in the brain. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that CART may act in the central nervous system to alter gastric function. Food consumption, gastric acid secretion, and gastric emptying were measured after injection of CART into the cerebrospinal fluid in 24-h fasted Sprague Dawley rats. Central injection of CART inhibited food intake, gastric acid secretion, and gastric emptying. In contrast, ip injection of CART failed to inhibit gastric acid secretion and gastric emptying, suggesting that CART acts in the brain to suppress gastric acid secretion and gastric emptying. In the vagotomized animals, centrally administered CART did inhibit pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. The CART-induced acid inhibition was also observed in rats treated with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. In contrast, pretreatment with central administration of a CRF receptor antagonist,α -helical CRF9–41, completely blocked the central CART-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion. All these results suggest that CART acts in the brain to inhibit gastric function via brain CRF system. The vagal pathway and the prostaglandin system are not involved in the acid inhibition.

AB  - Individual differences in locomotor responses to novelty and psychostimulants, and sensitization following repeated drug exposure, predict increased sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of psychostimulants and are thought to underlie vulnerability to drug addiction. This study tested whether these factors determine another core feature of drug addiction, the propensity for drug-seeking behavior during abstinence in rats with prior cocaine-self-administration experience. Low and high response groups for each of these factors were determined in outbred rats by the median locomotor response to novelty and amphetamine prior to cocaine self-administration (pre-test), and to amphetamine during abstinence (post-test). Cocaine-seeking behavior during abstinence was measured by the level of drug-paired lever responding during extinction, and also during reinstatement induced by cocaine-associated cues, an amphetamine priming injection, and footshock stress. Animals with low and high locomotor responses to novelty and the amphetamine pre-test showed similar levels of cocaine-seeking behavior during extinction and reinstatement testing. Locomotor responses to amphetamine following cocaine self-administration (post-test) also failed to determine amphetamine's ability to reinstate cocaine-seeking behavior. Conversely, high levels of amphetamine-induced reinstatement were associated specifically with escalating cocaine intake during prior self-administration. These animals also developed locomotor sensitization to amphetamine following cocaine self-administration (post-test vs. pre-test), but the capacity to develop locomotor sensitization was not sufficient to determine a propensity for cocaine-seeking behavior. The findings suggest that the relationship between locomotor responses to novelty, amphetamine and behavioral sensitization a,nd the propensity for cocaine-seeking behavior during abstinence is complex, while the level of drug intake during prior self-administration is a primary determinant of this behavior.

AB  - Acute exposure to cocaine transiently induces several Fos family transcription factors in the nucleus accumbens, a region of the brain that is important for addiction. In contrast, chronic exposure to cocaine does not induce these proteins, but instead causes the persistent expression of highly stable isoforms of ΔFosB. ΔFosB is also induced in the nucleus accumbens by repeated exposure to other drugs of abuse, including amphetamine, morphine, nicotine and phencyclidine. The sustained accumulation of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens indicates that this transcription factor may mediate some of the persistent neural and behavioural plasticity that accompanies chronic drug exposure. Using transgenic mice in which ΔFosB can be induced in adults in the subset of nucleus accumbens neurons in which cocaine induces the protein, we show that ΔFosB expression increases the responsiveness of an animal to the rewarding and locomotor-activating effects of cocaine. These effects of ΔFosB appear to be mediated partly by induction of the AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole) glutamate receptor subunit GluR2 in the nucleus accumbens. These results support a model in which ΔFosB, by altering gene expression, enhances sensitivity to cocaine and may thereby contribute to cocaine addiction.

AB  - BACKGROUND Mechanisms that mediate cocaine-induced cardiovascular events following vasoconstriction are incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of cocaine in moderate doses on hematologic and hemostatic parameters that influence blood viscosity and thrombotic potential. METHODS Changes in hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and red blood cell counts were measured in human subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for long-term cocaine abuse, before and sequentially after moderate intranasal and intravenous doses of cocaine. Hemostatic parameters, including von Willebrand factor, fibrinolytic activity, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor antigen, and tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen, were sequentially measured after intravenous cocaine or saline placebo with cardiac troponin subunits T and I. RESULTS Hemoglobin level (P=.002), hematocrit (P=.01), and red blood cell counts (P=.04) significantly increased from 4% to 6% over baseline from 10 to 30 minutes after intranasal (n=14) and intravenous (n=7) cocaine administration in doses of 0.9 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively, with no change in white blood cell or platelet counts. There was a significant increase (P=.03) in von Willebrand factor from 30 to 240 minutes, peaking at 40% over baseline following intravenous cocaine administration in a dose of 0.4 mg/kg (n=12), with no change after 0.2 mg/kg (n=3) or placebo (n=6). Other hemostatic factors, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and cardiac troponin subunits T and I showed no changes. CONCLUSIONS Cocaine induced a transient erythrocytosis that may increase blood viscosity while maintaining tissue oxygenation during vasoconstriction. An increase in von Willebrand factor without a compensatory change in endogenous fibrinolysis may trigger platelet adhesion, aggregation, and intravascular thrombosis.Arch Intern Med. 1999;159:1925-1930--

AB  - Objectives: To determine if the classic stroke risk factors, chronic hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, chronic alcohol abuse, older age, and male sex, are also risk factors in cocaine-related ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Methods: A computer search of ICD-9 codes identified 100 patients admitted to two inner city hospitals between 1986 and 1995 with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke who also tested positive for cocaine in the urine. The case records of these patients were reviewed retrospectively. The ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke groups were compared with a control group of 109 cocaine users without a history of stroke. Multiple logistic regression was performed to see if the classic stroke risk factors independently increased the risk of cocaine-induced ischemic and/or hemorrhagic stroke. Results: A total of 66 stroke patients in the study group had ischemic stroke, whereas 34 had hemorrhagic stroke. The stroke and control groups were similar in racial and gender composition. The mean ages of patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (both 41 years) were greater than the control group (34 years) (P<.01). Only chronic hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 5.2, P<.0001) and older age (OR 1.08/year increase of age, P<.0006) were independent risk factors for ischemic stroke. Female sex (OR 3.2, P<.015) and older age (OR 1.1/year increase of age, P<.0002) were independent risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke. Conclusions: Chronic hypertension and older age may magnify the risk of cocaine-related ischemic stroke, whereas female sex and older age may increase the risk of cocaine-related hemorrhagic stroke.

AB  - Abstract:  Rationale: Chronic cocaine abuse is associated with the development of anxiogenic states in humans. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is an endogenous neurotropic factor well known to modulate stress responses. It has been postulated that CRF is involved in the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the anxiety and/or stress responses associated with removal of cocaine after chronic administration. Objective: The present study investigated the role of endogenous CRF in mediating the “anxiety-like” effect 48 h after the cessation of saline or chronic cocaine treatment in rats, using the defensive burying paradigm and the elevated plus-maze. Methods: Rats received daily injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg IP, for 14 consecutive days) or vehicle. Forty-eight hours after the last injection, animals were tested in the plus-maze and then in the defensive burying paradigm. In a second experiment, intracerebroventricular (ICV) cannulae were implanted at the lateral ventricle. Animals were allowed a 1-week period for recovery before starting the chronic drug treatment. The defensive burying testing took place 48 h after cessation of the treatment. The CRF antagonist [DPhe<sup>12</sup>, Nle<sup>21,38</sup>, C<sup>α</sup>Me Leu<sup>37</sup>] r/h CRF<sub>(12–41),</sub> (also known as D-phe CRF<sub>(12–41)</sub>) (0.04, 0.2 and 1.0 μg/5 μl) was injected 5 min before the 15-min testing. Results: An “anxiogenic-like” effect following chronic cocaine treatment was demonstrated with the defensive burying paradigm, but not with the elevated plus-maze. This “anxiety-like” response was attenuated by ICV pretreatment with the CRF antagonist D-Phe CRF<sub>(12–41)</sub>, with the highest dose of the CRF antagonist reversing the observed “anxiogenic-like” response. Conclusions: These data suggest that brain CRF may be substantially involved in the development of “anxiety-like” responses related to cocaine withdrawal and could be important for future drug dependence treatments.

AB  - Aims. The factor structure of DSM‐IV substance disorder criteria is examined among alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and opiate users to determine the dimensionality of abuse and dependence criteria within each of these drug classes and whether a common construct can be generalized across drug classes. Design. 12‐month criterion prevalence was assessed as part of the World Health Organization's Study on the Reliability and Validity of the Alcohol and Drug Use Disorder Instruments in various settings at eight sites around the world using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN). A majority of respondents were recruited from non‐treatment settings. In addition to exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis was used to analyse factor structures using weighted least square methods and tetrachoric correlation matrices. Multi‐sample analysis techniques were used to model differences between drug‐classes. Findings. In the full data analyses identified a single factor solution for each user population and across user populations. However, analyses of data from users reporting low to moderate symptomatology identified a two‐dimensional construct among alcohol, cannabis and opiate users consisting of a major "dependence" factor and a lesser "abuse" factor. In addition, results showed that neither the abuse criterion "(A2) use in physical hazardous situations" or the dependence criterion "(D7) use despite knowledge of psychological/physical problems" were central to the latent construct in any of the user populations, except for D7 among alcohol users. Conclusions. The multi‐dimensional results found among users with low to moderate symptomatology indicate that: (1) previous results from relatively homogeneous populations may have been biased towards lesser order solutions, and that (2) the DSM‐IV substance disorder criteria describe at least two distinct phenomena, supporting the current DSM‐IV organization of substance disorder criteria. Further work needs to evaluate whether prevalent symptoms are present in random or predictable combinations, whether combinations reflecting a specific hierarchy of severity can be identified, and whether incident symptoms are accumulated in a predictable pattern, within specific user populations and across user populations.

AB  - We studied factors contributing to an increased risk of PPD positive status among 147 inpatients dually diagnosed for mental illness and substance abuse in a large urban hospital. Ninety-three percent (N = 137) were tested for PPD on admission. The rate of positive PPDs was 30.7%. Significant correlates of PPD positive status were the diagnosis of schizophrenia/psychosis NOS (p < .05), and crack cocaine use in the 30 days prior to admission (p <.01). A multiple logistic regression revealed a relative risk of 3.53 (p < .005) for PPD positive status for the crack using group and a relative risk of 2.16 (p < .06) for PPD positive status for the schizophrenic group. Reasons for why patients whose primary drug of abuse is crack cocaine and those whose diagnosis is schizophrenia/psychosis NOS may be at an increased risk for exposure to tuberculosis are discussed as are the implications for public health.

AB  - Addiction is an evocative psychological and medical term whose meaning has changed significantly over time. For most of this century it has been described in terms of an abstinence syndrome (dependence and withdrawal) and associated with heroin use. In the 1980s, however, cocaine replaced heroin as the prototypical drug of abuse. Cocaine had heretofore not been considered to produce "physical dependence." Nonetheless, for both cocaine and heroin, current models of addiction - models widely propagated by the media - reduce drug use patterns to the properties of drugs and biological characteristics of the user. In creating this model, scientific and clinical debates along with public debates rely on the supposedly typical, inevitably addicting results of repeated cocaine consumption. Yet naturalistic human drug use and drug taking by animals in the laboratory instead reinforce the picture that use of all drugs depends on the user's environment-Indeed, even the most severe examples of compulsive drug use can be reversed when key elements in the setting are modified. Such findings should by now play a fundamental role in both scientific and public conceptions of addiction, but they do not.

AB  - Abstract:  Although cocaine is a powerful reinforcer, it has been reported to produce anxiety in humans and anxiogenic-like behavior in animals. The goal of this study was three-fold: (1) to determine the doses of cocaine that induce anxiogenic-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze in rats, (2) to determine if cocaine-associated contextual cues are capable of eliciting anxiogenic-like behavior in the absence of the drug, and (3) to identify possible mechanisms through which cocaine-associated cues affect behavior in the elevated plus-maze. Measurement of the amount of time that the animals spend exploring the open arms of the maze provides a sensitive index of anxiogenic-like behavior in rats. In experiment 1, rats were injected with 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, or 30 mg/kg cocaine HCl or saline for 6 days. On day 6, the rats were tested in the elevated plus-maze 25 min after injection with cocaine or saline. The animals chronically treated with the three doses of cocaine exhibited a dose-dependent increase in anxiogenic-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze, compared to the saline-treated group. In experiment 2, cocaine-induced (30 mg/kg) conditioning was achieved using a simple contextual design. On the final day of the experiment (day 6), after 5 days of conditioning, the rats were exposed for 25 min to the cocaine-associated contextual cues, then placed in the elevated plus-maze. Animals that had been exposed to cocaine-associated contextual cues prior to being placed in the elevated plus-maze exhibited a significant increase in anxiogenic-like behavior compared to the control groups. However, pretreatment of the rats with the CRF antagonist, ∝-helical CRF<sub>9–41</sub> (1 μg, ICV), on the test day, prior to exposure to cocaine-associated contextual cues, attenuated the subsequent anxiogenic-like behavioral response in the elevated plus-maze (experiment 3). The results suggest that contextual cues associated with repeated treatment with 30 mg/kg cocaine are capable of eliciting anxiogenic-like behavior in the absence of the drug and that CRF mediates the expression of anxiogenic-like behaviors in the elevated plus-maze following exposure to cocaine-associated cues. The conditioned anxiogenic action elicited by cocaine-associated cues may have relevance for understanding the complex addictive nature of this drug and some of the clinical phenomena related to its use.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Cocaine addiction in humans develops gradually with repeated administrations and persists long after cocaine has cleared the body. The mechanisms underlying this persistent form of neuroplasticity are not understood and can involve both structural and biochemical mechanisms. The long time course for cocaine addiction in humans and for development of cocaine self‐administration in animal models suggests the involvement of alterations in gene expression leading to altered signaling in the brain. In the striatum (Str) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats, pretreatment with repeated cocaine administrations downregulates the induction of various immediate early genes (IEGs) by a subsequent acute challenge with cocaine. Some of these downregulated IEGs encode Fos‐related components of the activator protein‐1 (AP‐1) complex, which is likely to regulate a number of genes important for neuronal function. Interestingly, repeated cocaine administration induces novel delta FosB‐related proteins (called chronic Fos‐related antigens (Fras)) in the NAc and Str that replace the downregulated isoforms of Fos. Unlike the acutely induced, short‐lasting isoforms of Fos and FosB, the chronic Fras persist long after the last cocaine administration. The known form of delta FosB per se lacks the domain required to activate transcription. If the chronic Fras are similar in structure to delta FosB, then the induction of chronic Fras likely leads to a blockade of AP‐1‐dependent transcription resulting in altered gene expression. We are presently purifying the chronic Fras to obtain amino acid sequence in order to directly examine our hypothesis about the effects of repeated cocaine administration on AP‐1‐dependent transcription and gene expression in the brain.

AB  - Abstract:  The behavioral profile of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in mediating anxiogenic-like and aversive responses to stressors may be particularly relevant for dependence and withdrawal in drug-experienced organisms. Moreover, stressful aspects of drug exposure in the drug naive organism may also induce CRF system activation. In the present studies, the dependence of aversive properties of cocaine on activation of endogenous CRF systems has been evaluated in rats using taste conditioning and runway self-administration paradigms. Systemic cocaine administration (20 mg/kg IP) produced a conditioned saccharin aversion which was dose-dependently potentiated by central administration of the CRF receptor antagonist, D-phe CRF (12–41). In addition, IV cocaine administration (0.75 mg/kg per injection IV) produced runway goal-box avoidance and conditioned place avoidance responses which were significantly accelerated by CRF antagonist treatment. In contrast, CRF receptor stimulation using CRF itself abolished cocaine-induced increases in goal latency in the runway paradigm. This generalized involvement of CRF systems in cocaine-related motivational/associative states is consistent with the comprehensive role of CRF in mediating emotional responses to non-drug stressors.

AB  - Cocaine, as does exposure to other physiological stressors, releases brain corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), and this release habituates during the course of repeated cocaine administration in animals. Due to the many signs of anxiety and responses to stress that are produced by cocaine withdrawal in humans, the present study was designed to assess the effects of chronic cocaine and its withdrawal on regional 125I‐Tyr‐oCRF binding to the CRF1receptor in brains of male Lewis rats. Cocaine or saline was intravenously infused for 10 days in a regimen that resembled a self‐administration paradigm (1 mg/kg every 12 min for 2 h each day). Tissues were harvested either 15 min after or 10 days after the last cocaine infusion, and the brains were sectioned and prepared for CRF1receptor autoradiography. Compared with findings in saline controls, there was a 31% lower level of CRF binding sites in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala immediately after the last cocaine infusion, but not 10 days later. Neuroendocrine and non‐neuroendocrine mechanisms associated with CRF1receptors do not appear to contribute to long‐term withdrawal effects. Synapse 25:272–276, 1997. © 1997 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

AB  - Cocaine use is associated with modulation of a broad range of biological functions including the capacity to influence cytokine production in murine and human immunoeffector cells. Little is known, however, regarding the effects of cocaine on endothelial cell cytokine production. Because the vascular endothelium actively participates in acute and chronic inflammatory responses and interleukin-8 (IL-8) is one of the key cytokines involved in the inflammatory process, modification of the production of IL-8 by vascular endothelial cells may interfere with the host response to infection or tissue injury. We investigated the effect of cocaine on endothelial cell IL-8 production. Conditioned supernatant from EA.hy 926 cells were evaluated by ELISA followingin vitrococaine exposure. Cocaine decreased IL-8 production in a dose-responsive manner, and this reduction correlated with down-regulation of IL-8 mRNA expression. Cocaine also increased the production of TGF-β by EA.hy 926 cells and anti-TGF-β abrogated the cocaine-mediated decrement of IL-8 production, indicating that cocaine down-regulates endothelial IL-8 production by increasing TGF-β. Our findings suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of cocaine may be mediated, in part, by modification of endothelial-derived cytokine production.

AB  - Individuals prone to substance dependence suffer because they cannot regulate their emotions, self-esteem, and relationships. Furthermore, they suffer with deficits in self-care in which they fail to anticipate harm and danger, including those associated with substance use. Deficiencies in regulating emotions and self-care malignantly combine to make drug experimentation and dependence more likely and compelling.

AB  - In order to explore the possible confounding effects of age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status on developmental outcomes of prenatal cocaine exposure, two matched samples of preschoolers (20 children with cocaine/polydrug in utero exposure and 20 children with no prenatal drug exposure) were compared on the Stanford-Binet: 4th ed. (S-B: 4th ed.), Social Skills Rating System, Vineland Adaptive Behavior ScaleSurvey Form, Preschool Language Scale: 3rd ed. (PLS: 3rd ed.), and the Child Behavior Checklist. None of the 40 children had attended or were currently enrolled in preschool programs. Both groups had scores approximately one standard deviation below the expected mean in social skills, auditory comprehension, and expressive language. Likewise, externalizing behavior difficulties were approximately one standard deviation above the mean for both groups. Results suggest in utero drug exposure had no independent impact on cognitive, social, language, and behavioral developmental outcomes when the confounding variables of age, ethnicity, gender, and SES were controlled. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - AbstractPharmacotherapy trials for cocaine abuse among methadone-maintained patients have typically reported negative findings as well as high rates of cocaine use during the trial. The contribution of motivational factors to these results is a potentially important, underinvestigated area. This article points out that some methadone-maintained patients may enter a trial for cocaine abuse with little desire for treatment, motivated primarily to continue receiving methadone or to avoid program sanctions for continued cocaine use. Participation in clinical trials may constitute a phase delaying discharge in a cyclic pattern of multiple treatment episodes. Testing a pharmacologic agent in a motivationally inappropriate sample may not provide a good estimate of the agent's effectiveness. In view of the important public health role that methadone maintenance programs play in preventing HIV transmission, and the subversion of this role by intravenous cocaine use, solutions to these problems are urgently needed. The authors suggest several possible approaches, including pre- and posttreatment motivation assessment, as well as the inclusion of psychosocial interventions that provide the context for the emergence of potential medication effects.

AB  - The gateway hypothesis argues that most adolescents begin experimenting with cigarettes or alcohol, progress to marijuana use and finally to other illicit substance use. Prior research has supported this hypothesis, although prior research has not examined the effects of weekly marijuana use on specific illicit substances such as cocaine and has not attempted to identify psychosocial mediators of predictive relationships among substances. The current study uses longitudinal national survey data with six assessment periods and a comprehensive set of psychosocial risk factors for substance use to examine relationships between cocaine and marijuana use using discrete-time survival analysis for multiwave longitudinal data. The results of the current study show that weekly marijuana use, as opposed to initial marijuana use, is an independent risk factor for initial cocaine use. Weekly marijuana users were over ten times more likely to initiate cocaine within the next year. The results also show that many psychosocial predictors are not predictive of initial cocaine use after controlling for prior weekly marijuana use. However, the association between weekly marijuana use and cocaine use is, in part, mediated by delinquent attitudes. We conclude that weekly marijuana use is a risk factor for cocaine use that is equal to or greater in magnitude than other risk factors for initial cocaine use such as deviant peer bonding and attitudes toward deviance. These findings argue for some revision of the gateway hypothesis and psychosocial theories of substance use. In addition, the current research shows support for clinical observations which suggest that regular use of any illicit substance is likely to spawn experimentation with other illicit substances.

AB  - The relationship between addiction severity, psychiatric symptoms, AIDS risk behaviors, and an alternative five-factor measure of personality, the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire, was assessed in 92 cocaine-misusing pregnant and postpartum women in an inner city outpatient treatment program. Three of the personality traits (Neuroticism-Anxiety, Impulsive Sensation Seeking, Aggression-Hostility) were significantly related to different subscales of the Addiction Severity Index, Beck Depression Inventory, various psychiatric symptoms, and high HIV risk sexual activity. Of these traits, Neuroticism-Anxiety seemed to be the most powerful predictor of symptom severity for this sample of women. Scores on the personality dimensions were not related to recency, frequency, amount, or duration of drug use or to treatment outcomes.

AB  - Endogenous central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) may be involved in the neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to cocaine. In the present study, levels of CRF mRNA were measured in the hypothalamus and in several extrahypothalamic brain regions after different regimens of "binge"-pattern cocaine administration. Male Fischer rats were injected with saline or cocaine (15 mg/kg, 1 hr x 3/day) at the beginning of the light cycle, to approximate the manner in which cocaine is often abused by humans, both in terms of temporal pattern and in relation to circadian rhythm. Cocaine administered in this binge regimen produced time-dependent alterations of CRF mRNA levels in the hypothalamus. There was a significant increase in CRF mRNA levels on day 1, which returned to base-line levels on day 2, with elevated plasma corticosterone levels on both days. CRF receptor type 1 and prooplomeianocortin mRNA levels in the anterior lobe of the pituitary were not significantly altered after acute cocaine injections on day 1 or day 2. On day 14 of chronic binge-pattern cocaine administration, decreased hypothalamic CRF mRNA levels and an attenuated elevation in plasma corticosterone levels were found. After 10 days of withdrawal from 14-day binge cocaine, CRF mRNA returned to basal levels. CRF mRNA levels in the amygdala were also significantly increased on day 1 and returned to basal values on day 2. Chronic (14-day) binge cocaine administration did not alter CRF mRNA levels in the amygdala. These results suggest that the attenuated response in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to chronic binge cocaine administration is coupled to the cocaine-induced decreases in CRF gene expression in the hypothalamus and that activation of CRF gene expression in extrahypothalamic regions may have implications for a molecular understanding of the behavioral responses to cocaine.

AB  - Mice given five repeated administrations of methamphetamine (MAP: 2 mg/kg SC) or cocaine (COC: 20 mg/kg SC) at 3-day intervals in a round tilting-type activity cage (20 cm in diameter) showed sensitization to the ambulation-increasing effect of each drug. The mean 3- or 2-h overall activity count at the fifth administration of MAP or COC, respectively, was 2.3–2.5 times higher than that at the first administration. Mice given MAP or COC 4 times in round spaces (15–30 cm in diameter), where the floor did not tilt, exhibited sensitization as strong as that demonstrated by mice given each drug in the activity cages, when the mice were given the fifth administration in the activity cages. In contrast, mice repeatedly given the drugs in spaces 4–9 cm in diameter never, and those in space 12 cm in diameter only partially, exhibited sensitization to MAP and COC. Furthermore, mice given MAP or COC 4 times in their home cages (25D×20W×15H cm, with ten mice in each cage) showed partial sensitization. Repeated administration of saline to mice in activity cages, in the spaces 4–30 cm in diameter, or in the home cages did not cause significant change in the sensitivity to either MAP or COC. These results suggest that repeated experience of the stimulant effect of drug and the resultant ambulation is required for induction of sensitization to MAP and COC in terms of ambulation in mice. It is also suggested that spaces larger than 12 cm in diameter, which correspond to 2–2.5 times as long as the body length without tail, and no interference from other mice are required for induction of strong sensitization to both MAP and COC.

AB  - The dropout rates among cocaine abusers in outpatient treatment programs have averaged 55%. We sought to find patient predictor variables associated with early attrition. Dropouts were more likely to be African-American or Hispanic-American, younger, with an earlier onset of substance abuse. Among minorities, those with more education were less likely to drop out. Patients who were less educated and smoked or injected cocaine were particularly prone to discontinue treatment prematurely. The implications of these findings, and promising interventions for reducing the dropout problem, are discussed.

AB  - During the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in the number of children born with prenatal exposure to cocaine. However, there is very little hard data concerning the later development of these children. The purpose of this preliminary study was to compare the language development profiles of 5 children prenatally exposed to cocaine and associated risk factors to the language development profiles of a matched non-exposed control group in terms of analyses of the discourse-pragmatic, semantic, and form components of language. The language evaluation was based on the analysis of a 30-minute language sample. The results suggested differences between the two groups as well as differences within the cocaine-exposed group. The major differences between the two groups were in discourse-pragmatics although less marked differences in syntactic development were also found. The results are discussed in relation to the potential contribution of pertinent medical and environmental risk factors. The study suggests that for children with prenatal exposure to cocaine in combination with multiple associated risk factors, language development may be compromised.

AB  - The free (unbound) drug in serum is an important determinant of pharmacologic response. The present study was performed to more completely identify and evaluate factors affecting cocaine binding to human serum proteins. Protein binding was determined by ultrafiltration with [3H] cocaine. Cocaine binding parameters in serum from eight healthy volunteers were determined over a concentration range of 0.003 to 300 microM (0.001-100 micrograms/ml) and indicated cocaine binds to two classes of independent binding sites; one with high affinity [association constant (Ka) = 0.42 +/- 0.09 microM-1] and low capacity (N1 = 12.3 +/- 2.9 microM) and one with low affinity and high capacity (gamma = 0.41 +/- 0.05). Binding was concentration dependent with free fraction increasing from 0.16 +/- 0.05 to 0.68 +/- 0.02 over this concentration range. The binding capacity was significantly correlated with alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) concentration (r2 = 0.71, P = .0009). Binding studies were performed using AAG and human serum albumin (HSA) alone and together in phosphate buffer to determine the specific proteins responsible for cocaine binding. These studies revealed the binding of cocaine to AAG is potentiated by the presence of HSA as Ka for the first binding site increased from 0.08 microM-1 with AAG alone to 0.46 microM-1 with AAG combined with HSA 4 g/dl. Binding parameter estimates and cocaine free fraction in human serum and AAG 75 mg/dl plus HSA 4 g/dl in phosphate buffer were similar indicating that AAG and HSA are the principal binding proteins in serum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Cocaine stimulates ACTH secretion by a corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-dependent mechanism in male rats, rhesus monkeys, and humans. To determine the generality of this effect, we examined the effects of acute cocaine administration on the pulsatile release of ACTH and cortisol in three ovariectomized (OVX) rhesus monkeys and compared its effects to stimulation with CRF. Venous blood samples were collected at 2-min intervals for 60 min before and after iv administration of cocaine (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg) and CRF (1.0 and 10 micrograms/kg). Cluster analysis procedures were used to evaluate the pulsatile characteristics of ACTH and cortisol release. After placebo administration, an ACTH pulse frequency of 3 peaks/h was detected. After cocaine administration, plasma cocaine levels peaked at 92 +/- 3.0 and 201 +/- 60 ng/mL within 2 min. However, in contrast to normal intact males, cocaine did not stimulate the pulsatile release of ACTH in OVX females. Cocaine (0.4 mg/kg) decreased ACTH incremental peak height and valley levels compared with pre-cocaine values, and a higher dose of cocaine produced no changes in ACTH release. Bolus injection of a low dose of CRF (1.0 micrograms/kg, iv) significantly increased ACTH incremental peak height (P < 0.05), and a higher dose of CRF (10 micrograms/kg) increased ACTH peak amplitude, percentage increase in peak amplitude, area under the peaks, and incremental peak heights as well as ACTH valley level and nadir (10 micrograms/kg, iv) (P < 0.05). ACTH pulse frequency did not change after CRF or cocaine administration. Pulsatile release of cortisol was 2.7 peaks/h under placebo conditions and did not change after cocaine or CRF administration. Cortisol pulse amplitude was increased after low and high doses of CRF. High doses of CRF (10 micrograms/kg) also increased the mean level of cortisol valleys. In summary, we found that CRF but not cocaine stimulated pulsatile ACTH and cortisol release in OVX rhesus monkeys. The profound ACTH response to CRF challenge suggests that the CRF sensitivity and the ACTH release capacity of the anterior pituitary corticotroph cells were intact. The lack of stimulatory effects of cocaine on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in OVX monkeys, in contrast to normal male monkeys, may reflect the absence of gonadal steroids.

AB  - Variability in response to drug treatment is a poorly understood problem with severe consequences for both the individual and the health care delivery system. Our data suggest that one source of variability may be inherent in the way physiological systems normally respond to repeated drug exposures. We report that for a wide array of endpoints—amphetamine-evoked, in vitro striatal dopamine efflux, amphetamine and K+-evoked efflux of heart norepinephrine and nonevoked plasma levels of corticosterone and glucose – repeated, in vivo cocaine (15 mg/kg IP) administration to male rats precipitated successive oscillations in the magnitude or direction of the organism's responsiveness to subsequent cocaine administration. This capacity of cocaine to produce oscillations in response to successive administrations appears to be due to its foreign/stressful aspect rather than its specific pharmacological properties.

AB  - Motivational and decisional models suggest that those who seek help for substance use problems may differ from those who do not seek help in terms of their belief that substance use is creating social and personal negative consequences and their perceived dependence. In this study, help seeking for cocaine use was hypothesized to be a function of the negative consequences from cocaine, perceiving oneself as dependent on cocaine, quantity and frequency of use, cost of use, and route of administration. A sample of 161 substance abusers in treatment who had used any cocaine in the last 6 months completed questionnaires regarding the quantity, frequency, history, and perceptions of the consequences of their cocaine use. Of the 161 subjects, 113 (70.2%) had at some time sought help from someone for their cocaine use. After controlling for marital and employment status, a logistic regression revealed that the number of negative consequences experienced, feeling dependent on cocaine, and the amount of cocaine used were associated with seeking help for cocaine use. Additionally, a logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with cocaine users' reporting that they feel dependent on cocaine. Significant variables included number of negative consequences experienced and frequency of use. Consistent with motivational and decisional models, results suggest that clients' motivation to seek help for cocaine use is related primarily to adverse consequences of use. Theoretical and clinical implications of results are discussed.

AB  - Two types of narratives were obtained from 35 cocaine-addicted patients: narratives about using cocaine and narratives about not using cocaine. The most prevalent factors in using cocaine were (a) having enough money, (b) wish to end physical/emotional pain, and (c) wish/decision to use. The factors in narratives about not using cocaine were (a) patient arranged conditions to be nonstimulating for using cocaine, (b) recognition of bad consequences, and (c) wish/decision not to use. It is clear in both the cocaine-using episodes and not-using episodes that the patient's wish/decision is important. The conditions for using cocaine tended to be more external, whereas those for not using tended to be more internal. Similar conditions were found by a questionnaire method. A major treatment implication of these findings is that the focus of therapy can be directed to planning strategies to minimize influence of the external factors and to rehearse strategies to prepare for situations involving cues that influence use of cocaine.

AB  - Acute administration of cocaine increases expression of the transcription factor genes c-fos and zif268 in the striatum. This response is thought to be mediated via D1 dopamine (DA) receptors, as it is blocked by the selective D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390. However, the directly acting D1 receptor agonists, apomorphine and SKF 38393, do not mimic cocaine's activation of these genes raising the possibility that D1 receptor activation is necessary, but not sufficient, to trigger transcription factor expression. Because cocaine blocks uptake of norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT), as well as DA, we examined whether cocaine's ability to inhibit NE and 5-HT uptake may contribute to its induction of c-fos and zif268 expression in striatum. In examining the effects of selective monoamine uptake inhibitors, we observed that fluoxetine or citalopram, selective inhibitors of 5-HT uptake, potentiated the ability of mazindol, a DA and NE uptake inhibitor, to induce zif268 and c-fos expression, even though these 5-HT uptake inhibitors had no effect when administered alone. In contrast, the selective NE uptake inhibitor, desipramine, administered alone, or in combination with fluoxetine, did not increase expression of zif268 or c-fos. Furthermore, selective denervation of 5-HT projections by p-chloroamphetamine treatment attenuated the increase in zif268 and c-fos expression induced by cocaine in the striatum. In contrast, selective lesions of NE projections with N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride failed to block cocaine's activation of these genes in the striatum. Taken together, these findings indicate that cocaine's ability to induce striatal expression of c-fos and zif268 is mediated by its effects on both the 5-HT and DA systems.

AB  - The aim of the study was to ascertain whether there was a difference in developmental experiences between two groups of inner city postpartum patients, those who used cocaine during pregnancy and those who did not. A retrospective structured interview was administered to 80 postpartum women examining demographic characteristics, adaptive function, drug use patterns, and selected risk factors for adult substance abuse encountered before age 16. The sample was divided into two cohorts of women: 40 women identified by urine tests of their babies as using cocaine shortly before delivery and a comparison group of 40 women not identified by positive urines. Comparisons between the two cohorts revealed that the cocaine identified women had significantly higher overall past and present use of a broad range of drugs, particularly crack and other forms of cocaine, as well as lower levels of general adaptive functioning despite the fact that they were demographically comparable. When compared to the nonusers, they displayed markedly elevated scores on measures of developmental risk factors for adult substance use. This study highlights the importance of early developmental risk factors on later drug use during pregnancy and general adult adaptive functioning. Further study and intervention targeted at persons with these risk factors are warranted.

AB  - On-line Experimental investigations have been carried out to examine parameters which show marked changes in the performance of coke fired cupolas during melting such that a decrease in optimum conditions can be predicted. This decrease in performance usually results in increase in pollution levels, especially that of particulate emissions from the stack. Previous models by other workers have been examined and classified into three groups, those involving the use of heat transfer coefficients, thermodynamic and chemical methods, and models based on the statistical analysis of data.From the measurements of the top gases it is shown that the carbon monoxide levels identify problems within the melting zone and that a drop in the carbon monoxide level indicates that the iron temperature is about to fall and that foaming slag is developing.

AB  - (R, S)-ketamine has prophylactic antidepressant-like effects in rodents; however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its action remain unknown. Using RNA-sequencing analysis, we searched novel molecular target(s) that contribute to the prophylactic effects of (R)-ketamine, a more potent enantiomer of (R, S)-ketamine. Pretreatment with (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg, 6 days before) significantly ameliorated body weight loss, splenomegaly, and increased immobility time of forced swimming test in lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 1.0 mg/kg)-treated mice. RNA-sequencing analysis of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and subsequent IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) revealed that the nuclear factor of activated T cells 4 (NFATc4) signaling might contribute to sustained prophylactic effects of (R)-ketamine. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that (R)-ketamine significantly attenuated the increased gene expression of NFATc4 signaling (Nfatc4, Cd4, Cd79b, H2-ab1, H2-aa) in the PFC of LPS-treated mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with NFAT inhibitors (i.e., NFAT inhibitor and cyclosporin A) showed prophylactic effects in the LPS-treated mice. Similar to (R)-ketamine, gene knockdown of Nfatc4gene by bilateral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) into the mPFC could elicit prophylactic effects in the LPS-treated mice. In conclusion, our data implicate a novel NFATc4 signaling pathway in the PFC underlying the prophylactic effects of (R)-ketamine for inflammation-related depression.

AB  - The actions of retroviral infections, aging, and cocaine and morphine injection on cytokine production were investigated in C57BL/6 female mice. Retroviral infection with LP‐BM5 murine leukemia virus was further developed as a model of murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The effects of cocaine and morphine on gammainterferon (IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in vivo and with isolated spleen cells were measured by a sandwich enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Serum IFN was generally not detected in any group except mice injected with saline and young mice infected with LP‐BM5 virus. Splenocytes from mice with murine AIDS produced less IFN when stimulated in vitro by ConA. In aged mice, IFN production by spleen cells was severely suppressed by retroviral infection. Cocaine had a tendency to suppress IFN production by stimulated cells in vitro. Morphine tended to reduce IFN production by spleen cells from retrovirally infected animals. The serum TNF level in mice with murine AIDS was elevated creating higher levels in morphine and morphine plus cocaine treated uninfected mice while cocaine injection eliminated serum TNF. When stimulated in vitro by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), splenocytes from mice with murine AIDS also produced more TNF than uninfected controls. TNF production in vitro and in vivo was significantly increased by retroviral infection. Therefore, results indicate that cocaine and retroviral infection modulate TNF and IFN production.

AB  - Of 60 cocaine misusers seeking outpatient treatment, 33 (55%) dropped out by 4 weeks. Dropouts were more likely to be male, Black or Hispanic, or with no history of primary depression. Completers were more likely to be White, female, or depressed. The implications of these findings and possible strategies for reducing the dropout rate are discussed.

AB  - In Philadelphia, a large increase in syphilis among minority group heterosexuals began in 1986 and preceded similar increases elsewhere in the United States. To determine reasons for this increase, we conducted a case-control study in the metropolitan sexually transmitted diseases clinic during 1987 and 1988. Cocaine use (odds ratio [OR] 3.1; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.5, 6.5 among men; OR 5.8; 95% CI = 1.5, 33 among women) and exchange of drugs for sex (OR 3.5; 95% CI = 1.4, 8.7 among men) were risk factors for syphilis. Although cocaine users reported more sexual partners and more frequently reported sex with prostitutes, cocaine use remained a risk factor after adjustment for these behaviors. These data suggest that sexual behavior or another factor, such as availability or utilization of health care, among cocaine users leads to increased risk of syphilis in this population. Increases in cocaine use may be partly responsible for recent increases in syphilis incidence in the United States.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to re-evaluate the effects of cocaine on cardiac responses elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation. Cats anesthetized with pentobarbital and subjected to spinal cord transection were used. Control heart rate increases were obtained to submaximal stimulation of postganglionic accelerator nerves, before and after i.v. bolus doses of cocaine ranging from 0.0625 to 2.0 mg/kg. Maximal potentiation of heart rate increases elicited by nerve stimulation were observed with 0.25 mg/kg. In precocaine controls, stimulation increased sinus rate by 31 +/- beats/min; 30 sec to 1 min after cocaine (0.25 mg/kg), stimulation increased sinus rate by 55 +/- beats/min. Maximal potentiation (80 +/- 10%) was observed at 30 sec to 1 min after cocaine administration, and was usually over by 45 to 60 min later. Cocaine was repeated twice (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) at hourly intervals and the magnitude of potentiation was only 19 +/- 6 and 24 +/- 4%, respectively, indicating that tachyphylaxis had developed toward cocaine's potentiating effect. Dose-response studies indicated that as little as 0.0625 mg/kg of cocaine can potentiate heart rate increases elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation. Doubling the dose to 0.125 mg/kg, and again to 0.25 mg/kg, resulted in a linear dose-related increase in the magnitude of potentiation. However, doubling the dose again to 0.5 mg/kg and increasing this dose by 4-fold to 2 mg/kg did not result in additional potentiation. Indeed, there was a significant drop-off in the magnitude of potentiation to nerve stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Elevated Norepinephrine may be a Unifying Etiological Factor in the Abuse of a Broad Range of Substances: Alcohol, Nicotine, Marijuana, Heroin, Cocaine, and Caffeine

AB  - A wide range of commonly abused drugs have effects on the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system, including alterations during acute intoxication and chronic use of these drugs. It is not established, however, that individual differences in noradrenergic signaling, which may be present prior to use of drugs, predispose certain persons to substance abuse. This paper puts forth the novel hypothesis that elevated noradrenergic signaling, which may be raised largely due to genetics but also due to environmental factors, is an etiological factor in the abuse of a wide range of substances, including alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and caffeine. Data are reviewed for each of these drugs comprising their interaction with norepinephrine during acute intoxication, long-term use, subsequent withdrawal, and stress-induced relapse. In general, the data suggest that these drugs acutely boost noradrenergic signaling, whereas long-term use also affects this neurotransmitter system, possibly suppressing it. During acute withdrawal after chronic drug use, noradrenergic signaling tends to be elevated, consistent with the observation that norepinephrine lowering drugs such as clonidine reduce withdrawal symptoms. Since psychological stress can promote relapse of drug seeking in susceptible individuals and stress produces elevated norepinephrine release, this suggests that these drugs may be suppressing noradrenergic signaling during chronic use or instead elevating it only in reward circuits of the brain. If elevated noradrenergic signaling is an etiological factor in the abuse of a broad range of substances, then chronic use of pharmacological agents that reduce noradrenergic signaling, such as clonidine, guanfacine, lofexidine, propranolol, or prazosin, may help prevent or treat drug abuse in general.

AB  - We conducted a retrospective study of 116 hospitalized psychiatric patients treated with neuroleptic drugs. Nineteen of 45 cocaine users (42) and 10 of 71 nonusers (14) developed dystonic reactions during their hospitalizations. Based on this statistically significant finding, we suggest that cocaine use is a major risk factor for acute dystonic reactions.

AB  - Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist which interferes with the action of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) including glutamate and aspartate. The use of ketamine at subanaesthetic doses has increased because of its psychotomimetic properties. However, long-term ketamine abuse may interfere with memory processes and inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, an effect probably mediated by its NMDA antagonist action. Neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) serve as survival factors for selected populations of central nervous system neurons, including cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons. In addition, neurotrophins, particularly BDNF, may regulate LTP in the hippocampus and influence synaptic plasticity.

AB  - <sec><st>Background:</st> Dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex-nucleus accumbens pathway has been implicated in cocaine addiction. We have previously demonstrated that one intra-dorsomedial prefrontal cortex brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) infusion immediately following the last cocaine self-administration session caused a long-lasting inhibition of cocaine-seeking and normalized the cocaine-induced disturbance of glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens after extinction and a cocaine prime. However, the molecular mechanism mediating the brain-derived neurotrophic factor effect on cocaine-induced alterations in extracellular glutamate levels is unknown. </sec> <sec><st>Methods:</st> In the present study, we determined the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor on cocaine-induced changes in the phosphorylation of synapsin (p-synapsin), a family of presynaptic proteins that mediate synaptic vesicle mobilization, in the nucleus accumbens during early withdrawal. </sec> <sec><st>Results:</st> Two hours after cocaine self-administration, p-synapsin Ser9 and p-synapsin Ser62/67, but not p-synapsin Ser603, were increased in the nucleus accumbens. At 22 hours, only p-synapsin Ser9 was still elevated. Elevations at both time points were attenuated by an intra-dorsomedial prefrontal cortex brain-derived neurotrophic factor infusion immediately after the end of cocaine self-administration. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor also reduced cocaine self-administration withdrawal-induced phosphorylation of the protein phosphatase 2A C-subunit, suggesting that brain-derived neurotrophic factor disinhibits protein phosphatase 2A C-subunit, consistent with p-synapsin Ser9 dephosphorylation. Further, co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that protein phosphatase 2A C-subunit and synapsin are associated in a protein-protein complex that was reduced after 2 hours of withdrawal from cocaine self-administration and reversed by brain-derived neurotrophic factor. </sec> <sec><st>Conclusions:</st> Taken together, these findings demonstrate that brain-derived neurotrophic factor normalizes the cocaine self-administration–induced elevation of p-synapsin in nucleus accumbens that may underlie a disturbance in the probability of neurotransmitter release or represent a compensatory neuroadaptation in response to the hypofunction within the prefrontal cortex-nucleus accumbens pathway during cocaine withdrawal. </sec>

AB  - Introduction. A major challenge in cocaine dependent subjects is to know if a concomitant major depression episode is independent or induced by the substance. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is related to cerebral plasticity and impairment caused by substance abuse and depression. Objective. To evaluate the changes in BDNF in stress response in cocaine dependent patients with independent or substance-induced major depression. Materials and Methods. 24 cocaine dependent (CD) patients (DSM-IV-TR) (15 with comorbid independent major depression and 9 with comorbid cocaine-induced major depression) and 21 healthy controls. We used the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to evaluate the acute stress response in humans. BDNF serum levels and anxiety scores were measured before TSST, immediately after TSST and 90 minutes later. The data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA, One-Way ANOVA and post hoc analysis. Results. In cocaine dependent subjects, those with independent depression showed a stress response different to cocaine-induced depression. BDNF and Cortisol levels were statistically significant differences in patients with CD + comorbid independent major depression and CD + comorbid cocaine-induced major depression 90 minutes later TSST (P = 0,025/p = 0,004). Conclusions. These preliminary results show a different response to acute stress between patients with independent or cocaine-induced major depression.

AB  - In human cerebrospinal fluid substances were detected that are capable of reversibly displacing the hallucinogen d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) from its high-affinity binding sites in neuronal membranes. The binding sites may represent a specific type of LSD-serotonin receptor protein. The LSD-displacing factors (LDF) occur physiologically in concentrations high enough to interact with the putative LSD-serotonin receptors. The LDF can be separated from proteins and inorganic salts. LDF was found to be clearly different from endogenous indoleamine ligands such as serotonin, being anionic at pH 7.4.

AB  - To study the association of maternal cocaine use during early pregnancy with the occurrence of congenital urogenital anomalies, we analyzed data from the population-based Atlanta Birth Defects Case-Control Study. We identified 276 and 791 case-babies with urinary and genital anomalies, respectively, who were live born and stillborn to residents of metropolitan Atlanta from 1968 through 1980. There were 2835 and 2973 respective control-babies born without birth defects randomly selected through birth certificates. Maternal cocaine use during early pregnancy was defined as reported use at any time from 1 month before the pregnancy began through the first 3 months of pregnancy. We found a statistically significant association of reported cocaine use with an increased risk for urinary tract defects (crude odds ratio, 4.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 17.24) and no statistically significant association with genital organ defects (odds ratio, 2.26; confidence interval, 0.67 to 7.62).

AB  - Epidemiological studies of adolescent cocaine use are critically reviewed, risk factors for use are identified, and implications for prevention are discussed. Cocaine use among adolescents is increasing due, in part, to lower prices and the availability of “crack,” a potent smokable form of freebase cocaine. Although most use ends after mild to moderate experimentation, some users develop severe adverse consequences in a short period of time. Risk factors for initial cocaine use have been identified as male gender, use of marijuana, lack of social connections to family and school, peer influences, and psychopathology. However, further studies are needed to identify risk factors for developing more extensive or problematic cocaine use or abuse, including possible underlying biological factors. Prevention efforts should be targeted at preadolescents who show high risk characteristics. Parents, educators, and health care providers should all be involved in prevention programs, to provide a consistent message in the home, the school, and the popular media. Effective techniques that address the identified risk factors are required to maximize the success of prevention efforts.

AB  - To assess the effects of training dose on the discriminative stimulus properties of LSD, groups of rats (eight/group) were trained to discriminate each of three doses of LSD (0.02, 0.08 or 0.32 mg/kg) from saline. This was accomplished by using a method of progressively altering dose (“fading”). Dose-response tests revealed that the three LSD cues were specific to the dose used during training and that, as the training dose declined, the slope of the LSD dose-response curve became less steep. Substitution tests with direct serotonin (5-HT) agonists (quipazine, MK-212, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) and antagonism tests with central 5-HT antagonists (methiothepin and cyproheptadine) indicated that 5-HT is involved in mediating the in vivo effects of LSD and that training dose co-determines (along with the dose of the test compound) the extent of substitution or antagonism. In addition, substitution tests with the peripherally-active 5-HT agonist 5-methoxytryptamine and 5-HT antagonist xylamidine suggested that the peripheral serotonergic actions of LSD may be involved (in part) in the low dose (0.02 mg/kg) LSD cue. In contrast to 5-HT, dopamine (DA) did not appear to be involved in the discriminative stimulus properties of LSD, because no significant dose or group effects were seen during tests with the DA agonists apomorphine and d-amphetamine or the DA antagonist haloperidol.

AB  - Cocaine is becoming a major drug of abuse among the general population and among opiate addicts. Reports from the early 1970s found that most abusers were older Black males with some antisocial characteristics. Cocaine abuse at that time was reported by about 17% of opiate addicts seeking treatment and by 7 to 11% of ex-addicts on methadone maintenance. However, that rate increased dramatically during the 1970s, and in our 1980 study of 533 addicts we found that 74% of opiate addicts applying for treatment used cocaine. It was the second most abused nonopioid drug after marijuana, surpassing alcohol intoxication. Although the mean number of days of abuse over the previous 30 days was substantially lower among the addicts on our methadone maintenance program (x = 1.4 days, n = 120) than among the addicts applying for treatment (x = 9 days, n = 204), the following associations with cocaine abuse were consistent in both subsamples. Cocaine abuse was more frequent among Blacks. It was associated with a variety of antisocial indices including Research Diagnostic Criteria antisocial personality disorder, number of arrests, and legal, family, employment, and drug abuse problems as assessed by the Addiction Severity Index and the Social Adjustment Scale. Several differences emerged between Black and White cocaine-abusing addicts, the most interesting being an increased rate of anxiety disorders among White cocaine abusers. Based on these associations, we offer several guidelines for treating cocaine abuse in opiate addicts.

AB  - This study compares a sample of cocaine users in drug treatment programs to a sample of cocaine users not in treatment. These samples were compared on: (1) level of cocaine use, (2) consequences of use, (3) employment, (4) social support system, and (5) criminal behavior. These attributes were related to being in treatment. Among intermediate-level cocaine users, friendship patterns, employment, and criminal history were associated with treatment status. The implications for the treatment of cocaine use are addressed.

AB  - An engineering analysis indicates that the coke rate in present blast-furnace practice is set not by chemical or thermal needs but to give adequate charge permeability for economical driving rates. An equation showing interrelations among pressure drop, gas flow, and charge characteristics has been derived. Flooding conditions and the location of the fusion zone are discussed. Maximum ore size is probably limited by chemical reducibility rather than by heat transfer.

AB  - Pretreatment of the rats with 10 mg/kg of reserpine for 18–20 h abolished the responses to cocaine; the responses to transmural stimulation were reduced but not abolished. Addition of small quantities of guanethidine to these reserpine-treated preparations resulted in complete abolition of responses to transmural stimulation. The catecholamine stores of the rat vas deferens seem to be relatively resistant to the depleting actions of reserpine. These results indicate that the contractile responses of the rat vas deferens to cocaine are mediated through the release of endogenous catecholamines. An increase in the pH increased the responses to both cocaine and tetracaine, and a decrease in the pH decreased their contractile responses. Although the nonionized form of these local anesthetics seems to be essential for their action, the active molecular species responsible for eliciting contractions of the vas deferens remains unsettled. It is possible that a variation in pH might account for the divergent actions reported for these agents by earlier investigators.

Differences in the personality traits or disorders in CDP with or without CIP has been described. However, there are few studies studding the relationship between CIP and personality with a dimensional approach in order to clarify if there are any personal dimension related with CIP or/and personality disorders (PD) in CDP.

AB  - Ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but the magnitude of response varies considerably between individual patients. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been investigated as a biomarker of treatment response in depression and has been implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. We evaluated plasma BDNF and associations with symptoms in 22 patients with TRD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of ketamine compared to an anaesthetic control (midazolam). Ketamine significantly increased plasma BDNF levels in responders compared to non-responders 240 min post-infusion, and Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores were negatively correlated with BDNF (r</it>=-0.701, p</it> = 0.008). Plasma BDNF levels at 240 min post-infusion were highly negatively associated with MADRS scores at 240 min (r</it> = -0.897, p</it>=.002), 24 h (r</it> = -0.791, p</it> = 0.038), 48 h (r</it> = -0.944, p</it> = 0.001) and 72 h (r</it> = -0.977, p</it> = 0.010). No associations with BDNF were found for patients receiving midazolam. These data support plasma BDNF as a peripheral biomarker relevant to ketamine antidepressant response.

AB  - Recent reports suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could be a biomarker for relapse, drug craving and withdrawal severity. In particular, elevated BDNF levels among former cocaine users have been associated with higher rates of relapse in 90 d. However, no data are available on BDNF levels at baseline and during crack cocaine withdrawal. This study evaluated BDNF among crack cocaine users during inpatient treatment, before and after withdrawal, vs.</it> healthy controls. Clinical correlates with changes in BDNF levels were also assessed. Serum BDNF was evaluated in 49 male crack users on the first and last days of hospitalization and in 97 healthy controls. Serum BDNF was assayed using a sandwich ELISA kit. BDNF levels were significantly lower upon admission when compared to controls, even after adjustment for age, length of inpatient treatment, number of crack rocks used in the last 30 d, years of crack use and interaction between the latter two variables. At discharge, BDNF levels between patients and controls were similar. Number of crack rocks used in the last 30 d and years of crack use were inversely correlated with the outcome. Our findings show that BDNF levels increase during early crack cocaine withdrawal, at an inverse correlation with number of crack rocks used in the last 30 d and years of crack use.

AB  - Proteoglycans like syndecan-3 have complex signaling roles in addition to their function as structural components of the extracellular matrix. Here, we show that syndecan-3 in the lateral hypothalamus has an unexpected new role in limiting compulsive cocaine intake. In particular, we observe that syndecan-3 null mice self-administer greater amounts of cocaine than wild-type mice. This effect can be rescued by re-expression of syndecan-3 in the lateral hypothalamus with an adeno-associated viral vector. Adeno-associated viral vector delivery of syndecan-3 to the lateral hypothalamus also reduces motivation for cocaine in normal mice. Syndecan-3 limits cocaine intake by modulating the effects of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor, which uses syndecan-3 as an alternative receptor. Our findings indicate syndecan-3-dependent signaling as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of cocaine addiction.

AB  - While the health risks of using ecstasy warrant intervention development, a recent meta-analysis of determinants of ecstasy use identified a number of lacunae in the literature. Specifically, no studies were included that address behaviours other than 'using ecstasy' (e.g. 'trying out ecstasy' or 'ceasing ecstasy use'). However, because meta-analyses aim to integrate study results quantitatively, the resulting rigid exclusion criteria cause many studies to be discarded on the basis of their qualitative methodology. Such qualitative studies may nonetheless provide valuable insights to guide future research. To provide an overview of these insights regarding ecstasy use, the current study summarizes and combines what is known from qualitative and exploratory quantitative literature on ecstasy use.

AB  - Epidemiological evidence regarding the impact of drugs of abuse on HIV disease is mixed but points to a likely association between cocaine use (by different routes) and acquisition of either HIV infection or an AIDS-defining illness. In vitro studies indicate that cocaine increases replication of HIV in both stimulated and unstimulated human peripheral blood monocytes. Recent studies using the huPBL SCID mouse model demonstrate that systemic exposure to cocaine enhances HIV replication and spread in vivo. The huPBL SCID mouse and SCID-hu mouse provide potentially useful models for evaluating the impact of other drugs of abuse on HIV infection and the mechanisms mediating these effects.

AB  - Infections caused by community-associated strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) are associated with a marked and prolonged host inflammatory response. In a sepsis simulation model, we tested whether the anesthetic ketamine inhibits the macrophage TNF response to antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA bacteria via its antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated for 18 hrs with 105 to 107 CFU/mL inocula of either of two prototypical CA-MRSA isolates, USA300 strain LAC and USA400 strain MW2, in the presence of either vancomycin or daptomycin. One hour before bacterial stimulation, ketamine was added with or without MK-801 (dizocilpine, a chemically unrelated non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), APV (D-2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), NMDA, or combinations of these agents. Supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF concentration by ELISA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Latin America (LA), men who have sex with men (MSM) are the population most affected by HIV, crack/cocaine production and trafficking routes are well-established, and local consumption has risen sharply in recent years. Yet, drug use and associations with sexual risk behaviours among MSM remain largely unexamined LA despite being recognised as important drivers of HIV transmission in the USA. Variation in crack/cocaine consumption within LA is also unknown. METHODS: Data from participants self-identifying as MSM and aged 18 years and older in recent (2006–2009) respondent-driven sampling (RDS) studies using similar survey methodologies in nine high-population cities in Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras (N=2081) were pooled and analysed in a multilevel statistical framework to increase statistical power to evaluate past 12-month crack/cocaine consumption (CC). CC prevalence was estimated by study site, adjusting for sampling weights incorporating personal network and population sizes. Logistic, multilevel models identified correlates of CC, adjusted for intraclass correlation within levels defined by study site and recruitment chain, and partitioned variance in CC among levels. RESULTS: CC prevalence was 21.7% (95% CI 17.4 to 26.7) in the pooled sample and varied significantly across cities from 0.1% in Cochabamba, Bolivia to 44.5% in Ceiba, Honduras. In multivariate analysis, daily alcohol consumption (adjusted OR [AOR]=4.0), sexual debut of ≤ 12 (AOR=3.1) and 13–17 (AOR=1.9) years old, self-identifying as transexual/transgender/transvestite (TTT) (AOR=2.2), age 18–22 (vs >40) years (AOR=2.0), having a stable female partner (AOR=1.8) and ever purchasing sex (AOR=1.6) were associated with CC (p<0.05). Significant city-level random effects expressed as AOR were 5.4 (SE=1.3) and 2.7 (SE=1.3) in Ceiba and San Pedro Sula, Honduras, respectively and 3.4 (SE=1.2) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Of the total variance in CC, 29.3% was associated with unobserved differences among cities. Associations between CC and condom use at last sex, and recruitment chain, were non-significant (p>0.1). CONCLUSIONS: CC prevalence among MSM, and variation among cities in LA, are considerable. Associations with frequent drinking and sexual risk Behaviours likely compound HIV transmission risk among MSM and to female partners. Substance abuse prevention and treatment for MSM are needed, particularly among TTT, and in Honduras and Argentina.

AB  - Cocaine is a worldwide used drug and its abuse is associated with physical, psychiatric and social problems. The mechanism by which cocaine causes neurological damage is very complex and involves several neurotransmitter systems. For example, cocaine increases extracellular levels of dopamine and free radicals, and modulates several transcription factors. NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression involved in cellular death. Our aim was to investigate the toxicity and modulation of NF-κB activity by cocaine in PC 12 cells. Treatment with cocaine (1 mM) for 24 hours induced DNA fragmentation, cellular membrane rupture and reduction of mitochondrial activity. A decrease in Bcl-2 protein and mRNA levels, and an increase in caspase 3 activity and cleavage were also observed. In addition, cocaine (after 6 hours treatment) activated the p50/p65 subunit of NF-κB complex and the pretreatment of the cells with SCH 23390, a D1 receptor antagonist, attenuated the NF-κB activation. Inhibition of NF-κB activity by using PDTC and Sodium Salicilate increased cell death caused by cocaine. These results suggest that cocaine induces cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) and activates NF-κB in PC12 cells. This activation occurs, at least partially, due to activation of D1 receptors and seems to have an anti-apoptotic effect on these cells.

AB  - Brain neutrophic factors regulate neuronal growth, differentiation, plasticity and survival. In the present study, brain derivied neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were measured in juvenile and adults Fischer rats following cocaine/hypoxic (non‐ischemic hypoxia) exposure. Rats injected with cocaine (30mg/kg dissolved in saline vehicle, IP) were exposed to 9% O2(balance N2) for 35 min for 3 consecutive days. Control rats were injected with vehicle and were exposed to normoxic conditions (21% O2, balance N2). To determine the effects of hypoxia‐induced hypothermia (HIH) on brain BDNF and NGF concentrations, exposures were conducted at ambient temperatures of 20 and 32°C. Following a 1‐day latency period, hippocampal and cortex samples were removed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C pending ELISA analysis. Cocaine/hypoxia induced significant decreases in the juvenile hippocampal BDNF and NGF levels. These decreases occurred at both exposure temperatures, suggesting that HIH was not effective at reducing the deleterious effects of the cocaine/hypoxic exposure. In adult rats, cocaine/hypoxia caused significant increases in hippocampal NGF that were eliminated in animals exhibiting HIH. No significant changes in BDNF were detected in adult rats under any cocaine/hypoxic exposure condition. Although juvenile cortex NGF was significantly decreased in cocaine/hypoxic rats at 32°C, no other significant changes in cortex NGF or BDNF were detected in juvenile or adult rats. Taken together, these data indicate that the hippocampal tissue of juvenile and adult rats exhibit a differential sensitivity to cocaine/hypoxic exposure. This research was supported by a Peoria Next research grant.

AB  - Two-step tuberculin testing and standardized interviews of 793 current and former drug users were performed to determine the risk factors for tuberculin positivity. The prevalence of tuberculin positivity was 25%. Factors independently associated with tuberculin positivity among participants seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) included crack cocaine use (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0–2.5), employment as a home health aide (adjusted OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0–4.1), birth in Puerto Rico (adjusted OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3–3.6), foreign birthplace (adjusted OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.6–13.6), African American race (adjusted OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2–5.0), reported tuberculosis exposure (adjusted OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2–4.4), and older age (adjusted OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2–6.7). Additional risk factors among HIV-infected participants included alcoholism (adjusted OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.0–5.8) and high CD4+ lymphocyte count. Identification of and administration of appropriate chemoprophylaxis to drug users with these risk factors should be given high priority.

AB  - In order to evaluate race as a possible factor affecting the incorporation of drugs into human hair, 2 mg/kg deuterium-labeled cocaine (cocaine-d<inf>5</inf>) was administered intranasally to nine male non-Caucasian volunteers under controlled laboratory conditions. Sequential blood samples were collected for up to three days, and scalp hair samples were collected at 24 and 72 h after dosing and at monthly intervals for up to 12 months. The samples were then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for cocaine-d<inf>5</inf> and benzoylecgonine-d<inf>5</inf> (BZE-d<inf>5</inf>). The amounts of cocaine-d<inf>5</inf> found in the hair of these non-Caucasian subjects were compared with the amounts of cocaine-d<inf>5</inf> found in the hair of Caucasian subjects who received the same cocaine dose under identical conditions as part of a study we reported previously. The non-Caucasians in the present study had approximately 2.7 times more cocaine-d<inf>5</inf> in their hair than the Caucasian subjects in the earlier study. In five of the non-Caucasian subjects, cocaine-d<inf>5</inf> could be detected in hair within 24 h after dosing. Curiously, we were unable to detect any cocaine-d<inf>5</inf> in one of the non-Caucasian subjects hair at any time after dosing even though cocaine-d<inf>5</inf> was in plasma at the expected levels. The results from these studies suggest there may be a racial bias in the incorporation of cocaine into human hair; however, the data are not conclusive because of the relatively small sample size.

AB  - To evaluate the role of personality in cocaine abuse, 59 adults meeting DSM-III criteria for cocaine abuse were compared to similar-aged non-cocaine alcohol abusers and community controls on a DSM-III measure of personality. Cocaine abusers were more likely than non-cocaine alcohol abusers to display narcissistic personality traits (Odds ratio 6.86, 95% CI = 4.52, 15.60). (Am J Public Health 1989; 79:891-892.

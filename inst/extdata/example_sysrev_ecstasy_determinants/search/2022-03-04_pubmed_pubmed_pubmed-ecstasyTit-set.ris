TI  - Key transcription factors mediating cocaine-induced plasticity in the nucleus 
      accumbens.
LID - 10.1038/s41380-021-01163-5 [doi]
AB  - Repeated cocaine use induces coordinated changes in gene expression that drive 
      plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), an important component of the brain's 
      reward circuitry, and promote the development of maladaptive, addiction-like 
      behaviors. Studies on the molecular basis of cocaine action identify transcription 
      factors, a class of proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate 
      transcription, as critical mediators of this cocaine-induced plasticity. Early 
      methods to identify and study transcription factors involved in addiction 
      pathophysiology primarily relied on quantifying the expression of candidate genes in 
      bulk brain tissue after chronic cocaine treatment, as well as conventional 
      overexpression and knockdown techniques. More recently, advances in next generation 
      sequencing, bioinformatics, cell-type-specific targeting, and locus-specific 
      neuroepigenomic editing offer a more powerful, unbiased toolbox to identify the most 
      important transcription factors that drive drug-induced plasticity and to causally 
      define their downstream molecular mechanisms. Here, we synthesize the literature on 
      transcription factors mediating cocaine action in the NAc, discuss the advancements 
      and remaining limitations of current experimental approaches, and emphasize recent 
      work leveraging bioinformatic tools and neuroepigenomic editing to study 
      transcription factors involved in cocaine addiction.

TI  - Key interindividual determinants in MDMA pharmacodynamics.
PG  - 183-195
LID - 10.1080/17425255.2018.1424832 [doi]
AB  - MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, is a synthetic phenethylamine derivative 
      with structural and pharmacological similarities to both amphetamines and mescaline. 
      MDMA produces characteristic amphetamine-like actions (euphoria, well-being), 
      increases empathy, and induces pro-social effects that seem to motivate its 
      recreational consumption and provide a basis for its potential therapeutic use. 
      Areas covered: The aim of this review is to present the main interindividual 
      determinants in MDMA pharmacodynamics. The principal sources of pharmacodynamic 
      variability are reviewed, with special emphasis on sex-gender, race-ethnicity, 
      genetic differences, interactions, and MDMA acute toxicity, as well as possible 
      therapeutic use. Expert opinion: Acute MDMA effects are more pronounced in women 
      than they are in men. Very limited data on the relationship between race-ethnicity 
      and MDMA effects are available. MDMA metabolism includes some polymorphic enzymes 
      that can slightly modify plasma concentrations and effects. Although a considerable 
      number of studies exist about the acute effects of MDMA, the small number of 
      subjects in each trial limits evaluation of the different interindividual factors 
      and does not permit a clear conclusion about their influence. These issues should be 
      considered when studying possible MDMA therapeutic use.

TI  - Cognitive dysfunction in individuals with cocaine use disorder: Potential moderating 
      factors and pharmacological treatments.
PG  - 203-214
LID - 10.1037/pha0000245 [doi]
AB  - It is well-documented in the literature that individuals repeatedly exposed to 
      cocaine exhibit cognitive impairment and that cognitive dysfunction is a risk factor 
      for poor treatment outcomes in those with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Specific 
      deficits related to attention, episodic memory, working memory, and executive 
      functioning are the most common deficits noted in this population. Given that 
      cognitive impairment is a risk factor for poor treatment outcomes in those with CUD, 
      identifying possible moderating factors contributing to and/or exacerbating 
      cocaine-related cognitive deficits is of great importance. Some of these factors may 
      include premorbid intellectual functioning, cocaine use patterns, polysubstance use, 
      comorbid emotional symptoms, and sleep dysfunction. It is plausible that by 
      identifying moderating factors impacting cognition, behavioral interventions can 
      then be modified accordingly and/or treatment regimens can be augmented with 
      pharmacological interventions (e.g., cognitive enhancing agents), leading to a 
      reduction in treatment attrition and improved treatment outcomes. The currently 
      available treatments for CUD are mainly behavioral with variable efficacy, and even 
      though there have been great preclinical and clinical research efforts focused on 
      medication development for CUD, there are currently no Food and Drug 
      Administration-approved medications for CUD. A description of some of the several 
      potential moderating factors, along with some pharmacological treatments which have 
      been shown to ameliorate, at least to some extent, cognitive dysfunction in those 
      with CUD are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights

TI  - Rhabdomyolysis, Methamphetamine, Amphetamine and MDMA Use: Associated Factors and 
      Risks.
PG  - 429-437
LID - 10.1080/15504263.2020.1786617 [doi]
AB  - Rhabdomyolysis is associated with methamphetamine, amphetamine, and 
      methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MA) use. The aim of this study was to determine the 
      frequency, severity, and risk factors of rhabdomyolysis associated with MA use. 
      Methods: We reviewed patients with an MA-positive toxicology screen with and without 
      diagnosed rhabdomyolysis based on initial creatine kinase (CK) concentration over a 
      period of 6 years. Demographics, vital signs, disposition, diagnoses, and laboratory 
      results were recorded. Results: There were 7,319 patients with an MA-positive 
      toxicology screen, of whom 957 (13%) were screened for rhabdomyolysis and included 
      in the study. The majority were male, White, and middle-aged and smoked tobacco. 
      Psychiatric (34%), neurological (15%), and trauma (13%) were the most common 
      discharge diagnostic groups. The majority (55%) were admitted, and 8% were 
      discharged to an inpatient psychiatric facility. Concomitant substance use included 
      ethanol (10%) and cocaine (8%), and 190 (20%) had rhabdomyolysis with median 
      (interquartile range) CK of 2,610 (1,530-6,212) U/L and range 1,020 to 98,172 U/L. 
      There was significant difference in renal function between the rhabdomyolysis and 
      non-rhabdomyolysis patients. Other differences included gender and troponin I 
      concentration. A higher proportion of patients screening positive for both MA and 
      cocaine use experienced rhabdomyolysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis 
      revealed elevated troponin I, blood urea nitrogen, and/or creatinine concentration 
      and male gender to be significant factors associated with rhabdomyolysis. 
      Conclusions: The frequency of rhabdomyolysis in patients screening positive for MA 
      was 20%. Factors associated with rhabdomyolysis in MA-positive patients included 
      elevated troponin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine concentration, and male gender. 
      Clinicians caring for patients who screen positive for MA should also consider 
      concomitant rhabdomyolysis, especially if renal/cardiac laboratory tests are 
      abnormal and even if there is no history of injury, agitation, or physical 
      restraint.

AB  - Introduction: Cocaine users often present with repetitive events of 
      cocaine-associated chest pain (CACP), clinically resembling acute coronary 
      syndromes. The aim of the study is to describe the specific risk factors for CACP. 
      Method: Cocaine users (n = 316) were recruited for a multicenter cross-sectional 
      study. Lifetime CACP history, sociodemographic factors, and lifetime use of cocaine 
      and other substances were assessed. Thirty single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 
      NOS3, ROCK2, EDN1, GUCY1A3, and ALDH2 genes, suggested by the literature on coronary 
      spasms, were selected. The associations with CACP history were tested using the 
      chi-square test, Student's t-test and logistic regression. Results: Among the 316 
      subjects [78.5% men, mean age 37.5 years, (standard-deviation ±8.7)], 190 (60.1%) 
      were daily cocaine users and 103 (32.6%) reported a lifetime CACP history. Among 
      those with a lifetime CACP history, the median was 10 events per individual. In 
      multivariate analysis, lifetime CACP history was associated with daily cocaine use 
      [odds-ratio (OR) 3.24; 95% confidence intervals (1.29-9.33)], rapid route of cocaine 
      use [OR 2.33 (1.20-4.64) vs. intranasal use], and lifetime amphetamine use [daily 
      amphetamine use: OR 2.80 (1.25-6.32) and non-daily amphetamine use: OR 2.14 
      (1.15-4.04) vs. never used]. Patients with lifetime opioid maintenance treatment 
      (OMT) reported significantly less lifetime CACP history [OR 0.35 (0.16-0.76)]. None 
      of the selected SNPs was associated with CACP history after multiple testing 
      corrections. Conclusions: Clinical variables describing the intensity of stimulant 
      use were positively associated with lifetime CACP history, while OMT was negatively 
      associated with it. Specific harm reduction strategies can target these risk 
      factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crack-cocaine dependence is a serious public health issue, related to 
      several psychiatric and psychosocial problems. Crack-cocaine users are usually 
      embedded in a context of great social vulnerability, often associated with violence, 
      poverty, family conflict and easy and early access to alcohol, tobacco and other 
      drugs. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled a consecutive sample of 577 
      patients admitted to 20 therapeutic communities located in Southern Brazil, between 
      September 2012 and September 2013. A structured interview assessed life-time 
      exposure to risk and protective factors for drug use, such as parental monitoring in 
      childhood, deviant behaviors and peer pressure. RESULTS: Presence of family conflict 
      (p = 0.002), maltreatment (p = 0.016), and deviant behavior prior to age 15 in a 
      bivariate analysis predicted an earlier age of crack-cocaine initiation, whereas 
      adolescents experiencing parental monitoring during adolescence started use later 
      (p < 0.001). In the multivariate model, perceptions related to ease of access of 
      illicit drugs (marijuana: p = 0.028, 95% CI = - 3.81, - 0.22; crack-cocaine: 
      p < 0.001, 95% CI = - 7.40, - 4.90), and deviant behavior (threatening someone with 
      a gun: p = 0.028, 95% CI = - 2.57, - 0.14) remained independent predictors of early 
      age of crack-cocaine initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Early onset of crack-cocaine use seems 
      to be associated with exposure to family conflict, easy access to drugs and deviant 
      behavior. Treatment and preventive programs should take these factors into account 
      when designing and implementing community interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anecdotal evidence suggests a substantial proportion of individuals with 
      cocaine use disorder do not report craving during inpatient detoxification. 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine prevalence and clinical correlates of consistent absence of 
      cocaine craving among inpatients during detoxification. We hypothesized that craving 
      absence would be associated with less severity of cocaine use, depression, and 
      anxiety. Alternative explanations were also explored. METHODS: Craving absence 
      (i.e., non-cravers) was defined as a daily score of zero across two separate craving 
      visual analogue scales in each of the inpatient days. Participants scoring ≥1 on ≥1 
      day were considered cravers. Severity of cocaine use disorder as well as 
      in-treatment depression and anxiety were assessed. Alternative contributors included 
      presence of cocaine and other substances in urine at admission, in-treatment 
      prescription of psychotropic medications, treatment motivation, executive function, 
      interoception, and social desirability. RESULTS: Eighty-seven participants (78.2% 
      males) met criteria as either non-cravers (n = 29; 33.3%) or cravers (n = 58; 
      66.7%). Mean length of admission in non-cravers and cravers was, respectively, 10.83 
      and 13.16 days. Binary logistic regression model showed that non-cravers scored 
      significantly lower than cravers on cocaine use during last month before treatment 
      (OR, 95% CI; 0.902, 0.839-0.970), in-treatment depression (OR, 95% CI; 0.794, 
      0.659-0.956), and in-treatment prescribing of antipsychotics (OR, 95% CI; 0.109, 
      0.014-0.823). Model prediction accuracy was 88.9%. CONCLUSIONS: One in three 
      patients undergoing inpatient detoxification experienced absence of craving, linked 
      to less pretreatment cocaine use, better mood, and decreased administration of 
      antipsychotics. Findings may inform pretreatment strategies and improve treatment 
      cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Coking is a substantial source of carbonaceous aerosols in China, but the emission 
      characteristics and pollution levels of coking-produced organic carbon (OC) and 
      elemental carbon (EC) remain unknown, causing considerable uncertainty in emission 
      estimates. In this study, the emission factors of OC (EF(OC)) and EC (EF(EC)) of 
      typical coking plants in Shanxi, China, were measured. The measured EF(EC) and 
      EF(OC) from fugitive emissions (7.43 and 9.54 g/t) were significantly higher than 
      those from flue gas (1.67 and 3.71 g/t). The technological conditions of coke 
      production affect the emissions of OC and EC. For example, the total emissions from 
      coke plants that use 3.2-m-high coke ovens were greater than those from plants that 
      use 4.3- and 6-m-high ovens. The EF(OC) and EF(EC) for plants conducting stamp 
      charging were considerably higher than those for plants using top charging. The 
      stable carbon isotopes of total carbon (δ(13)C(TC)), OC (δ(13)C(OC)), and EC 
      (δ(13)C(EC)) for fly ash during coking were -23.74‰ to -24.17‰, -23.32‰ to -23.87‰, 
      and -23.84‰ to -24.14‰, respectively, and no clear isotopic fractionation was found 
      during coke production. Different EC/OC ratios from different emission pathways and 
      the carbon isotope signature of coke production should be considered when 
      investigating the sources of carbonaceous aerosols. The total estimated EC and OC 
      emissions from coke production in China were 3.93 and 5.72 Gg in 2017, and Shanxi, 
      Hebei, and Shaanxi made the largest contributions.

AB  - Ketamine (KET), an anesthetic, analgesic, and a sedative N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
      receptor antagonist agent, exposure during neonatal period may lead to learning 
      impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive decline in the later years of 
      life. In recent studies, it has been reported that sedative-acting α2 agonist 
      dexmedetomidine (DEX), which is commonly used in clinical practice with KET, has 
      neuroprotective effects and prevents the undesirable effects of anesthesia. To 
      elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these actions, we investigated the 
      interaction between NMDA receptors α(2) adrenoceptor and adulthood behaviors in 
      neonatally KET and/or DEX administrated mice. Balb/c male mice were administrated 
      with saline, KET (75 mg/kg), DEX (10 µg/kg), or KET + DEX (75 mg/kg + 10 µg/kg) on 
      postnatal day 7. During adulthood (8-10 weeks old) mice were subjected to elevated 
      plus maze, open field, and Morris water maze tests. After behavioral tests, 
      hippocampus samples were extracted for mRNA expression studies of NMDAR subunits 
      (GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B) and α(2) adrenoceptor subunits (α(2A), α(2B), and α(2C)) 
      by real-time PCR. Ketamine increased horizontal and vertical locomotor activity 
      (p < 0.01) and impaired spatial learning-memory (p < 0.05). DEX increased 
      anxiety-like behavior (p < 0.01), but did not affect spatial learning-memory and 
      locomotor activity. KET + DEX impaired spatial learning-memory (p < 0.01), increased 
      horizontal locomotor activity (p < 0.01), and anxiety-like behavior (p < 0.05). Our 
      study implies that DEX cannot prevent the adverse effects of KET, on spatial 
      learning-memory, and locomotor activity. In addition to this, it can be thought that 
      during brain development, there is an interaction between NMDAR and α(2) 
      adrenoceptor systems.

AB  - Several meta-analyses of observational studies have addressed the association 
      between risk and protective factors and cannabis/cocaine/opioid use disorders, but 
      results are conflicting. No umbrella review has ever graded the credibility of this 
      evidence (not significant/weak/suggestive/highly suggestive/convincing). We searched 
      Pubmed-MEDLINE/PsycInfo, last search September 21, 2020. We assessed the quality of 
      meta-analyses with the AMSTAR-2 tool. Out of 3,072 initial references, five were 
      included, providing 19 associations between 12 putative risk/protective factors and 
      cannabis/cocaine/opioid use disorders (cases: 4539; N = 1,118,872,721). While 84 % 
      of the associations were statistically significant, none was convincing. One risk 
      factor (smoking) had highly suggestive evidence for association with nonmedical use 
      of prescription opioid medicines (OR = 3.07, 95 %CI:2.27 to 4.14). Convincing 
      evidence emerged in sensitivity analyses on antisocial behavior and cannabis use 
      disoder (OR 3.34, 95 %CI 2.53-4.41). Remaining associations had weak evidence. The 
      quality of meta-analyses was rated as moderate in two (40 %), low in one (20 %), and 
      critically low in two (40 %). Future research is needed to better profile 
      risk/protective factors for cannabis/cocaine/opioid use disorders disorders 
      informing preventive approaches.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of psychotic symptoms in cocaine-dependent patients.
PG  - 187-97
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cocaine consumption can induce transient psychotic symptoms expressed as 
      paranoia or hallucinations. This work reviews that evidence and tries to obtain data 
      regarding frequency of psychotic symptoms or cocaine induced psychosis (CIP), risks 
      or associated factors. METHOD: Systematic review of studies found in PubMed database 
      published until January 2011 where cocaine induced paranoia was present. RESULTS: 
      Cocaine induced paranoia has a particular clinical presentation. It needs to be 
      clearly identified due to its harmful consequences. The prevalence is between 12% in 
      clinical studies and 100% in experimental studies. The following are considered 
      potential risk factors: age of first use and length, amount of substance, route of 
      administration, body mass index, genetic factors, personal vulnerability and 
      comorbidity with AXIS I (psychosis, ADHD) and AXIS II disorders (antisocial 
      personality disorder). CONCLUSIONS: It is needed to research with larger samples of 
      cocaine users of different countries and contexts, in order to identify and detail 
      what variables are closely related in the development of cocaine induced paranoia, 
      so the population at risk can be treated earlier.

TI  - Peer presence and familiarity as key factors to reduce cocaine intake in both rats 
      and humans: an effect mediated by the subthalamic nucleus.
LID - 10.1007/s00213-021-06033-0 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Stimulant use, including cocaine, often occurs in a social context whose 
      influence is important to understand to decrease intake and reduce associated harms. 
      Although the importance of social influence in the context of drug addiction is 
      known, there is a need for studies assessing its neurobiological substrate and for 
      translational research. OBJECTIVES: Here, we explored the influence of peer presence 
      and familiarity on cocaine intake and its neurobiological basis. Given the 
      regulatory role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on cocaine intake and emotions, we 
      investigated its role on such influence of social context on cocaine intake. 
      METHODS: We first compared cocaine consumption in various conditions (with no peer 
      present or with peers with different characteristics: abstinent peer or drug-taking 
      peer, familiar or not, cocaine-naive or not, dominant or subordinate) in rats 
      (n = 90). Then, with a translational approach, we assessed the influence of the 
      social context (alone, in the group, in a dyad with familiar or non-familiar peers) 
      on drug intake in human drug users (n = 77). RESULTS: The drug consumption was 
      reduced when a peer was present, abstinent, or drug-taking as well, and further 
      diminished when the peer was non-familiar. The presence of a non-familiar and 
      drug-naive peer represents key conditions to diminish cocaine intake. The STN lesion 
      by itself reduced cocaine intake to the level reached in presence of a non-familiar 
      naive peer and affected social cognition, positioning the STN as one neurobiological 
      substrate of social influence on drug intake. Then, the human study confirmed the 
      beneficial effect of social presence, especially of non-familiar peers. CONCLUSION: 
      Our results indirectly support the use of social interventions and harm reduction 
      strategies and position the STN as a key cerebral structure to mediate these 
      effects.

      Resistant Depression.

LID - 10.2147/NDT.S273287 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ketamine exhibits antidepressant properties in treatment-resistant 
      depression (TRD) with some concern over its cardiovascular safety and tolerability 
      issues. This paper reports on the cardiovascular safety in short-term intravenous 
      ketamine treatment in TRD inpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 
      bipolar disorder (BP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The observational study population 
      comprises 35 MDD and 14 BP subjects treated with intravenous ketamine. RESULTS: 
      Blood pressure (RR) and heart rate (HR) values returned to baseline within 1.5-hours 
      post infusion with no sequelae for all study subjects. Six time points were analyzed 
      for each infusion: 0', 15', 30', 45', 60' and 90' for RR and HR. After the infusion 
      significant peaks in systolic (p = 0.004) and diastolic (p = 0.038) RR were seen. In 
      concomitant medication with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), higher 
      RR peaks (p = 0.020; p = 0.048) were seen as compared to other subjects. The 
      decrease in HR was greater (p = 0.02) in the absence of concomitant medication with 
      mood stabilizers as compared to subjects receiving mood stabilizing medication 
      accompanied by the observation of a greater decrease in diastolic RR among those 
      taking mood stabilizers (p = 0.009). LIMITATIONS: The study may be underpowered due 
      to the small sample size. The observations apply to an inhomogeneous TRD population 
      in a single-site, pilot study, with no blinding and are limited to the acute 
      administration. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates good safety and tolerability 
      profile of intravenous ketamine as add-on intervention to current psychotropic 
      medication in TRD, regardless of the MDD or BP type of mood disorders. The abatement 
      of elevated RR and BP scores was observed in time with no sequelae nor harm. Still, 
      cardiovascular risks appear to be more pronounced in subjects with comorbid arterial 
      hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Risk and Protective Factors for Alcohol, Marijuana, and Cocaine Use Among Child 
      Welfare-Involved Youth.
PG  - 88-94
LID - 10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.09.037 [doi]
AB  - Youth involved in child welfare services (CWS) are at elevated risk for substance 
      use. CWS involvement may provide an opportunity for intervention to prevent 
      subsequent use; however, little is known about mitigating substance use risk in this 
      population. Using data from the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent 
      Well-Being (NSCAW II), the present study examined individual, psychological, and 
      contextual risk factors (e.g., prior substance use, depression, posttraumatic 
      stress, maltreatment experiences) and protective factors (e.g., caregiver 
      monitoring, peer relationships) following CWS involvement (Wave 1) in relation to 
      alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine use 36 months later (Wave 3). The 
      nationally-representative sample of CWS-involved youth was restricted to individuals 
      who were aged 11 years or older at Wave 1 and had at least a partial interview at 
      Wave 3 (N = 763). Three logistic regression models showed that Wave 1 substance use 
      increased the likelihood of marijuana and cocaine use at Wave 3 [marijuana OR = 1.41 
      (1.19-1.68); cocaine OR = 1.26 (1.07-1.50)] but not binge alcohol use [OR = 1.44 
      (0.95-2.19)]. Other risk and protective factors had limited predictive value for 
      Wave 3 substance use. The present findings suggest that initiating substance use 
      prior to or at the time of CWS involvement is a critical risk factor for later 
      substance use. Substance use screening and referral to treatment is imperative for 
      CWS-involved youth.

TI  - Prevalence of tick-borne haemoparasites and their perceived co-occurrences with 
      viral outbreaks of FMD and LSD and their associated factors.

AB  - Species of Theileria, Babesia, and Anaplasma are Tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) that 
      are prevalent throughout the world, particularly in the tropical and subtropical 
      regions. Associated diseases of Theileriosis, Babesiosis, and Anaplasmosis, 
      respectively, represents a major threat to livestock production in many countries. 
      TBPs have a high prevalence in different geographical locations in Egypt. Foot and 
      mouth disease (FMD) and Lumpy skin disease (LSD) are considered endemic bovine viral 
      diseases in Egypt. Our clinical observations during the epidemics of LSD and FMD 
      viruses showed higher prevalence rates for the TBPs. To investigate this 
      correlation, a total of 670 samples from cattle and buffalo were collected during 
      the summers of 2017 and 2018 distributed throughout ranches and smallholders in two 
      geographical locations in Egypt. Two farms with a recent clinical outbreak of LSD 
      with a total of 270 animals, while the other location included three farms with a 
      recent FMD outbreak with a combined 400 cattle. Examined animals were classified 
      mainly according to age, gender, species, breed (native versus crossbred), and the 
      presence of ticks. Whole blood samples were collected for TBPs and viral (LSD and 
      FMD) examinations, while tissue specimens were collected for detection of FMD and 
      LSD viruses by real-time PCR. Our results confirmed significantly higher prevalence 
      rates for the TBPs in LSD-positive than LSD-negative animals, while no significant 
      difference could be detected for the prevalence rate of the TBPs in the FMD positive 
      and negative groups. The prevalence of Babesia and Theileria was significantly (P < 
      0.05) higher in cross-breeds than native cattle. Infections with Anaplasma and 
      co-infections with Babesia-Anaplasma and Theileria-Anaplasma were significantly 
      higher in native than cross-breeds cattle. The intensity of parasitic infection 
      (parasitemia) has a significant difference in the positive groups for the two 
      viruses compared to the negative groups. These results collectively confirming the 
      enhancing role of LSD on the prevalence rate of the haemoprotozoal infections 
      leading to more serious outcomes to the livestock infections, and therefore the 
      control of haemoprotozoal infections should be implemented as a part of viral 
      epidemics control.

AB  - Global warming remains one of the greatest challenges. One of the most prominent 
      solutions is to close the carbon cycle by utilizing the greenhouse gas: CO(2,) and 
      CH(4), as a feedstock via the dry reforming of methane (DRM). This work provided an 
      insight into how the NiCo bimetallic catalyst can perform with high stability 
      against coking during DRM compared to the Ni and Co monometallic catalysts, in which 
      the experimental and computational techniques based on density functional theory 
      were performed. It was found that the high stability against coking found on the 
      NiCo surface can be summarized into two key factors: (1) the role of Co weakening 
      the bond between a Ni active site and coke (2) significantly high surface coke 
      diffusion rate on NiCo. Moreover, the calculation of the surface fraction weighted 
      rate of coke diffusion which modeled the real NiCo particle into four regions: 
      Ni-dominant, Co-dominant, NiCo-dominant, and the mixed region consisting a 
      comparable amount of the former there regions, have shown that the synthesis of a 
      NiCo particle should be dominated with NiCo region while keeping the Ni-dominant, 
      and Co-dominant regions to be as low as possible to facilitate coke diffusion and 
      removal. Thus, to effectively utilize the coke-resistant property of NiCo catalyst 
      for DRM, one should together combine its high coke diffusion rate with coke removal 
      mechanisms such as oxidation or hydrogenation, especially at the final diffusion 
      site, to ensure that there will not be enough coke at the final site that will cause 
      back-diffusion.

TI  - Social cognitive determinants of ecstasy use to target in evidence-based 
      interventions: a meta-analytical review.
PG  - 109-18
AB  - AIMS: The health hazards and prevalence of ecstasy use have been documented in two 
      decades of research, but no review reporting on potentially modifiable antecedents 
      of use is available. The aim of this study was to integrate systematically research 
      identifying cognitive correlates of ecstasy use. Such research has the potential to 
      identify targets for evidence-based interventions designed to discourage use. 
      METHODS: The databases PsycINFO and MedLine were searched, inclusion criteria 
      applied to resulting hits, and descendency and ancestry approaches applied to the 
      selected publications. Reported associations between cognitive determinants, 
      including intention to use and ecstasy use measures, were synthesized by calculating 
      a weighted mean effect size, r. RESULTS: The pattern of associations lent support 
      both to the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the expectancy approach as 
      descriptions of potentially useful determinants. Attitudes were associated most 
      strongly with intention and use, followed by subjective norm and perceived 
      behavioural control. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of the strength of associations and 
      the potential modifiability of identified cognitions suggests that evidence-based 
      interventions to discourage ecstasy use should target negative expectancies, 
      perceived behavioural control and anticipated regret, and consider tailoring 
      perceived behavioural control elements.

AB  - Cocaine-induced transient hallucinations (CIH) are a frequent complication following 
      cocaine intake that is associated with addiction severity. METHODS: Two hundred and 
      forty-two non-psychotic and Caucasian lifetime cocaine users were included in a 
      French multicentric study. Clinical variables and dopamine pathway genotype data 
      were extracted and tested with CIH scores using a zero-inflated binomial model, 
      which allows for the exploration of factors associated with occurrence and severity 
      separately. RESULTS: Cocaine dependence (p(occurrence)= 6.18 × 10(-5), 
      p(severity)= 9.25 × 10(-8)), number of cocaine dependence DSM IV-Tr criteria 
      (p(occurrence)= 1.22 × 10(-7), p(severity)= 5.09 × 10(-6)), and frequency of intake 
      during the worst period of misuse (p(occurrence)= 8.51 × 10(-04), p(severity)= 0.04) 
      were associated with greater occurrence and higher severity of CIH. The genetic 
      associations did not yield significant results after correction for multiple tests. 
      However, some nominal associations of SNPs mapped to the VMAT2, DBH, DRD1, and DRD2 
      genes were significant. In the multivariate model, the significant variables were 
      the number of cocaine dependence criteria, lifetime alcohol dependence, and the 
      nominally associated SNPs. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that CIH occurrence and 
      severity are two distinct phenotypes, with shared clinical risk factors; however, 
      they likely do not share the same genetic background.

AB  - Cocaine and methamphetamine are widely used illicit psychostimulants worldwide, with 
      steadily increasing global markets that may impact on the frequency of use. 
      Importantly, their use typically begins in youth. This is a particular concern 
      because there is a link between the early age of first substance use and severity of 
      substance use disorder later in life. The aim of the present study was therefore to 
      investigate trends in prevalence, frequency, and age of onset of cocaine or 
      methamphetamine use between 2005 and 2018 in the United States, using the nationally 
      representative NHANES datasets. Factors associated with the ages of cocaine or 
      methamphetamine use onset were also identified. From 2005 to 2018, prevalence and 
      frequencies of cocaine or methamphetamine use increased, while age of onset remained 
      relatively stable (~20 years of age). Annual household income, use of other 
      substances, and intravenous drug use were identified as factors associated with 
      early onset cocaine or methamphetamine use. These factors have important 
      implications toward developing new prevention programs to reduce psychostimulant 
      use.

TI  - A structured review of reasons for ecstasy use and related behaviours: pointers for 
      future research.
PG  - 230
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-9-230 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the health risks of using ecstasy warrant intervention 
      development, a recent meta-analysis of determinants of ecstasy use identified a 
      number of lacunae in the literature. Specifically, no studies were included that 
      address behaviours other than 'using ecstasy' (e.g. 'trying out ecstasy' or 'ceasing 
      ecstasy use'). However, because meta-analyses aim to integrate study results 
      quantitatively, the resulting rigid exclusion criteria cause many studies to be 
      discarded on the basis of their qualitative methodology. Such qualitative studies 
      may nonetheless provide valuable insights to guide future research. To provide an 
      overview of these insights regarding ecstasy use, the current study summarizes and 
      combines what is known from qualitative and exploratory quantitative literature on 
      ecstasy use. METHODS: The databases PsycINFO and MedLine were searched for 
      publications reporting reasons for ecstasy use and related behaviour, and the 
      results were structured and discussed per behaviour and compared over behaviours. 
      RESULTS: Two main categories of reasons were found. The first category comprised 
      reasons to start using ecstasy, use ecstasy, use ecstasy more often, and refrain 
      from ceasing ecstasy use. The second category comprised reasons to refrain from 
      starting to use ecstasy, use less ecstasy, and cease using ecstasy. Reasons for 
      related behaviours within each of these two categories appear to differ, but not as 
      substantially as between the two categories. A large number of reasons that were not 
      yet explored in quantitative research emerged. CONCLUSION: The current summary and 
      combination of exploratory studies yields useful lists of reasons for each 
      behaviour. Before these lists can inform interventions, however, they beg 
      quantitative verification. Also, similarity of determinant configurations of 
      different behaviours can be assessed by addressing determinants of several 
      behaviours in one study. Another important finding is that meta-analytical 
      integration of the literature may overlook important findings and implications. 
      Thus, qualitative reviews remain useful instruments in setting the research agenda.

AB  - This paper explores the recent resurgence in use of ecstasy/MDMA in Europe and 
      highlights keys areas of continuity and divergence between the ecstasy market of the 
      1990s and the current MDMA market. Based on a scoping study involving a targeted 
      multi-source data collection exercise on MDMA, it highlights nine areas that have 
      undergone some level of change, linked with both supply and demand for the drug. 
      Factors discussed include: innovation in production techniques; changes in precursor 
      chemical availability; the role of online markets; competition with other stimulants 
      and new psychoactive substances; the increased availability of high-strength MDMA; 
      and the shift from subcultural towards more mainstream use of the drug. The paper 
      proposes that the MDMA on Europe's contemporary market is in some respects a third 
      generation product with a different consumer profile, with implications that 
      responses developed at the time of the drug's earlier iteration, may be in need of a 
      review and revamp.

AB  - Young adults with longstanding ketamine abuse present with lower urinary tract 
      symptoms (LUTSs), which may be accompanied by urinary tract infection (UTI). 
      However, the morbidity and risk factors for ketamine-associated LUTS accompanied by 
      UTI (KALAUTI) are still unknown. To ascertain these, we surveyed patients with a 
      history of ketamine abuse and LUTS at the time of their initial presentation.One 
      hundred untreated patients with ketamine-associated LUTS were initially surveyed at 
      3 medical institutions. The patients' basic demographic and clinical information, 
      KALAUTI status, and possible risk factors were obtained via a questionnaire and 
      analyzed.Eighty-one patients were finally enrolled. Eight patients (9.88%) had a 
      definitive diagnosis of KALAUTI and 16 (19.75%) had suspected KALAUTI. The diagnosis 
      of KALAUTI was ruled out in the remaining 57 patients (70.37%). Patients with upper 
      urinary tract involvement, longer duration of drug use, or more severe LUTS 
      (P < .05), were more prone to KALAUTI. Frequent urine culture and a higher voiding 
      symptom score (VSS) were risk factors for KALAUTI (P < .05), increasing the risk of 
      KALAUTI by 44.241- and 1.923-fold, respectively.The study indicates that frequent 
      urine culture and severe VSS are risk factors for KALAUTI. The possibility of UTI 
      should be considered in ketamine abusers with LUTS in the clinical setting.

      infusion patterns, associated conditioned stimuli and spatial-temporal contexts. Our 
      aim was to study the pharmacological and non-pharmacological factors that regulate 
      the acquisition of ketamine use. METHODS: In experiment 1, four groups of male rats 
      were trained to self-administer ketamine during nine 1-h daily sessions, under four 
      reinforcement schedules: i) pre-session ketamine priming (Priming-[KET]), ii) 
      conditioned stimulus (CS) paired to the ketamine infusions ([KET + CS]), iii) 
      neither priming nor CS ([KET]), iv) combination of both (Priming-[KET + CS]). In 
      experiment 2, two groups of male rats were trained to self-administer ketamine 
      during nine 1-h daily or weekly sessions, under the Priming-[KET + CS] schedule. 
      Lever pressing was then extinguished by saline substitution for ketamine infusion. 
      Afterwards, ketamine was made available again upon responding under the same 
      schedule. RESULTS: The Priming-[KET + CS] schedule of reinforcement showed a 
      significant increase in the number of ketamine reinforcements and a significant 
      discrimination between active vs. inactive levers. The same schedule allowed the 
      establishment of ketamine self-administration on a weekly basis. During the 
      extinction phase, rate of responding significantly dropped in both weekly and daily 
      groups although it was twofold longer in the former, which showed a lack of 
      reacquisition. CONCLUSIONS: Both pre-session ketamine priming and a conditioned 
      stimulus paired to the ketamine infusions are required for the acquisition of 
      ketamine self-administration. The longer extinction and the lack of reacquisition in 
      the weekly group could be due to changes in temporal context that might affect the 
      conditioning process.

AB  - AIMS: To estimate the prevalence of cocaine binging and examine associated factors, 
      to characterize binge episodes and to study the relationship between cocaine binging 
      and HIV and HCV risk behaviors among street-based cocaine users. METHODS: A 
      prospective cohort study was conducted in Montréal, Canada. Interviewer-administered 
      questionnaire were carried out at 3-month intervals. Cocaine binging was defined as 
      using large quantities of cocaine, without stopping, over a limited period of time, 
      until resources run out or until being physically incapable of consuming. 
      Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) analyses were used. Covariates considered 
      included demographic, behavioral, mental health and social risk factors. FINDINGS: 
      In total, 605 participants were recruited. Prevalence of cocaine binging over the 
      month prior to recruitment was 24.5%. Correlates of cocaine binging were older age 
      (AOR 1.46), homelessness (AOR 1.44), criminal/marginal income strategies (AOR 1.61), 
      high psychological distress (AOR 1.31), high cocaine dependence (AOR 3.71), drug 
      overdoses (AOR 1.56) and smoking as the main route of cocaine administration (AOR 
      1.38). Additional GEE analyses showed that cocaine binging was significantly 
      associated with the sharing of drug paraphernalia (AOR 1.35) and sexual relations 
      under the influence of cocaine (AOR 1.21). CONCLUSION: Cocaine binging is frequent 
      among street-based cocaine users and is associated with markers of vulnerability. It 
      is also associated with increased odds of both sexual and drug use risk behaviors. 
      Interventions need to be tailored in order to help cocaine bingers develop personal 
      strategies that could prevent binging. Harm reduction programs should help cocaine 
      bingers adequately assess their drug equipment needs.

PG  - 176-82
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.07.003 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence and correlates of cocaine injection initiation 
      and the impacts of daily cocaine injection among a cohort of injection drug users. 
      METHODS: Among 1603 participants, from May 1996 to December 2005, risk factors for 
      initiation of cocaine injection among baseline heroin users were determined by Cox 
      proportional hazards regression and correlates of daily cocaine injection by 
      generalized estimating equations. FINDINGS: Of the 238 individuals who had never 
      injected cocaine, 200 (84%) had at least one follow-up visit and 121 (61%) 
      consequently initiated into cocaine injection, yielding an incidence density of 
      initiation into cocaine injection of 21.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 17.9-25.8) 
      per 100 person-years. In a multivariate model, Downtown Eastside (DTES) residence 
      (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=2.46, 95% CI: 1.68-3.60), incarceration (AHR=1.50, 95% 
      CI: 1.01-2.24), requiring help injecting (AHR=1.57, 95% CI: 0.99-2.49), and binge 
      drug use (AHR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.22-2.73) remained associated with initiation into 
      cocaine injection. DTES residence (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.99, 95% CI: 
      1.62-2.46), unstable housing (AOR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.53), incarceration (AOR=1.29, 
      95% CI: 1.04-1.60), sex trade involvement (AOR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.15-1.85), requiring 
      help injecting (AOR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.73-2.58)), borrowing syringes (AOR=1.81, 95% CI: 
      1.35-2.43) and binge drug use (AOR=2.16, 95% CI: 1.81-2.58) were independently 
      associated with daily cocaine injection. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline prevalence and 
      subsequent incidence of initiation into cocaine injection was high. Daily cocaine 
      injection was independently associated with a number of health and social harms, 
      including elevated HIV risk behavior.

TI  - Reasons for discontinuation of acute postoperative pain ketamine infusions: A 
      retrospective case-control study.
PG  - 759-765
LID - 10.1111/papr.13012 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to investigate factors associated with early 
      discontinuation of low-dose ketamine infusions due to adverse drug events (ADEs). 
      METHODS: A retrospective, matched case-control study of surgical patients who 
      received low-dose ketamine infusions for postoperative pain over 6 years was 
      conducted. Forty-seven study patients, who required early discontinuation of their 
      infusion due to ADEs, were included and matched 1:1 with 47 controls, who did not 
      experience ADEs, for a total of 94 patients. The two groups were compared based on 
      surgery type, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, 
      administration of specific perioperative anxiolytic, anesthetic, and analgesic 
      medications, and use of regional anesthesia. RESULTS: Of the study patients, 44.7% 
      underwent spine procedures (vs. 34% of controls), 27.6% underwent abdominal 
      procedures (vs. 8.5% of controls), 19.2% underwent orthopedic procedures (vs. 46.8% 
      of controls), and 8.5% underwent thoracic procedures (vs. 6.4% of controls). There 
      were no statistically significant differences in ASA classification, pre-operative 
      gabapentinoid and antidepressant use, average ketamine infusion dose, or 
      postoperative use of peripheral nerve catheters, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, muscle relaxants, and nonbenzodiazepine sleep aides. 
      Study patients had higher rates of intra-operative volatile anesthetic use (78.7% 
      vs. 57.7%, p = 0.03) and more postoperative opioid patient-controlled analgesia 
      (PCA) use (53.2% vs. 29.8%, p = 0.02) than controls. Control patients had higher 
      rates of preoperative opioid use (76.7% vs. 53.2%, p = 0.02) and premedication with 
      midazolam (89.4% vs. 70.2%, p = 0.02) than study patients. CONCLUSION: Patients who 
      required discontinuation of their low-dose ketamine infusion due to ADEs were more 
      likely to be opioid naïve, received less pre-operative benzodiazepines, and had 
      greater postoperative opioid PCA requirements. Control patients, on the other hand, 
      had higher rates of pre-operative opioid use and experienced fewer ADEs despite 
      greater total ketamine doses.

TI  - Pharmacological and environmental determinants of relapse to cocaine-seeking 
      behavior.
PG  - 327-36
AB  - Animal models have been developed that simulate relevant features of relapse to 
      cocaine-seeking behavior in humans. These models have provided valuable information 
      about pharmacological and environmental factors that precipitate reinstatement of 
      extinguished cocaine-seeking in rats and monkeys, as well as new insights about 
      potential pharmacotherapies for relapse prevention. Reinstatement of cocaine-seeking 
      behavior in animals can be induced by cocaine priming or by cocaine-paired 
      environmental stimuli: however, maximum reinstatement of drug-seeking appears to be 
      induced when cocaine priming and cocaine-paired stimuli are combined. Drugs that 
      share cocaine's indirect dopamine agonist properties or that act as direct agonists 
      at D2-like dopamine receptors also induce reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, 
      whereas with some exceptions (e.g., caffeine, morphine) drugs from other 
      pharmacological classes do not. D1-like receptor agonists block rather than mimic 
      the priming effects of cocaine, suggesting different roles for D1- and D2-like 
      receptor mechanisms in cocaine relapse. Although considerable overlap exists, drugs 
      that exhibit cocaine-like discriminative stimulus and/ or reinforcing effects in 
      other situations do not invariably induce cocaine-like reinstatement of drug-seeking 
      and vice versa, implying that these effects are not simply different behavioral 
      expressions of a unitary neurobiological process. Finally, recent findings with 
      D1-like receptor agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists suggest that some of 
      these drugs may be viable candidates for development as antirelapse 
      pharmacotherapies.

TI  - Acquisition of MDMA self-administration: pharmacokinetic factors and MDMA-induced 
      serotonin release.
PG  - 874-84
LID - 10.1111/adb.12069 [doi]
AB  - The current study aimed to elucidate the role of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and 
      neurotransmitter efflux in explaining variability in (±) 3, 
      4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) self-administration in rats. PK profiles of 
      MDMA and its major metabolites were determined after the administration of 1.0 mg/kg 
      MDMA (iv) prior to, and following, the acquisition of MDMA self-administration. 
      Synaptic levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) and dopamine (DA) in the nucleus 
      accumbens were measured following administration of MDMA (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, iv) 
      using in vivo microdialysis and compared for rats that acquired or failed to acquire 
      MDMA self-administration. Effects of the 5HT neurotoxin, 5,7 dihydroxytryptamine (5, 
      7-DHT), on the acquisition of MDMA and cocaine self-administration were also 
      determined. In keeping with previous findings, approximately 50% of rats failed to 
      meet a criterion for acquisition of MDMA self-administration. The PK profiles of 
      MDMA and its metabolites did not differ between rats that acquired or failed to 
      acquire MDMA self-administration. MDMA produced more overflow of 5HT than DA. The 
      MDMA-induced 5HT overflow was lower in rats that acquired MDMA self-administration 
      compared with those that did not acquire self-administration. In contrast, 
      MDMA-induced DA overflow was comparable for the two groups. Prior 5,7-DHT lesions 
      reduced tissue levels of 5HT and markedly increased the percentage of rats that 
      acquired MDMA self-administration and also decreased the latency to acquisition of 
      cocaine self-administration. These data suggest that 5HT limits the initial 
      sensitivity to the positively reinforcing effects of MDMA and delays the acquisition 
      of reliable self-administration.

TI  - Interpersonal Risk Factors for Suicide in Cocaine Dependence: Association with 
      Self-Esteem, Personality Traits, and Childhood Abuse.
PG  - 867-883
LID - 10.1111/sltb.12621 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies have linked cocaine dependence to suicidality. According to the 
      Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, suicidal behavior becomes likely with the 
      simultaneous presence of perceived burdensomeness (PB), lack of (or thwarted) 
      belongingness (TB), and acquired fearlessness about death (FAD). Here, we examined 
      personality and other variables, including depression, self-esteem, childhood abuse, 
      and substance use, as predictors of these risk factors in cocaine-dependent 
      individuals (CDs). METHODS: Seventy CDs and 70 healthy controls (HCs) participated. 
      We examined group differences in a group-by-sex analysis of variance and identified 
      predictors of PB, TB, and FAD in stepwise regressions. RESULTS: CDs exhibited 
      elevated PB and TB but not FAD, compared to HCs. CDs also exhibited elevated harm 
      avoidance, novelty seeking, depression, and lower self-esteem and reward dependence. 
      Females reported elevated sexual abuse, harm avoidance, reward dependence, 
      depression, but lower FAD, relative to males, among CDs and HCs. Among CDs, PB was 
      predicted by lower self-esteem and greater emotional abuse; TB was predicted by 
      lower self-esteem and reward dependence, as well as greater emotional and sexual 
      abuse; and FAD was predicted by lower harm avoidance and greater physical abuse. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Interventions targeting suicidality in cocaine dependence should take 
      into consideration self-esteem, personality traits, and childhood abuse.

TI  - Role of environmental factors in cocaine addiction.
PG  - 6996-7008
AB  - Decades of experimentation with a variety of pharmacological treatments have 
      identified some effective therapies for heroin addiction but not for cocaine 
      addiction. This may be due, at least in part, to our incomplete understanding of the 
      factors involved in the differential vulnerability to these addictions, which are 
      often considered mere variations of the same disorder. Indeed, the preference for 
      one drug or another has been variously attributed to factors such as drug 
      availability or price, to the addict's lifestyle, or even to chance. Yet, there is 
      evidence of substance-specific influences on drug taking. Data from twin registries, 
      for example, suggest that a sizeable portion of the variability in the 
      susceptibility to drug abuse is due to environmental factors that are unique to 
      opiates or to psychostimulants. Very little is known about the nature of these 
      environmental influences. We report here original data, based on retrospective 
      reports in human addicts, indicating that the setting of drug taking exerts a 
      differential influence on heroin versus cocaine use. We also review additional 
      clinical and pre-clinical data pointing to fundamental differences in the way in 
      which the environment interacts with cocaine relative to heroin and other addictive 
      drugs. These findings - as well as other evidence, including the lack of 
      pharmacological treatments effective for both cocaine and heroin addiction - support 
      the notion that much is to be gained by taking into account the substance-specific 
      aspects of drug addiction. At a therapeutic level, for example, it appears 
      reasonable to propose that cognitive-behavioral approaches should be tailored in a 
      substance-specific manner in order to allow the addict to anticipate, and cope with, 
      the risks associated to the various environmental settings of drug use.

TI  - Determinants of high availability of methamphetamine, cannabis, LSD and ecstasy in 
      New Zealand: Are drug dealers promoting methamphetamine rather than cannabis?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Small towns in New Zealand have reported high availability of 
      methamphetamine, and conversely a shortage of cannabis. Stakeholders have suggested 
      drug dealers are purposely promoting methamphetamine rather than cannabis. AIMS: (1) 
      To compare the availability of methamphetamine and cannabis in different size 
      communities; (2) Identify determinants of the high availability of methamphetamine, 
      including low availability of cannabis. METHOD: An online drug survey was promoted 
      via a broadly targeted Facebook™ campaign. Participants were asked if they lived in 
      a "city", "small town" or "rural area", their drug use patterns, and local drug 
      market characteristics, including current availability. A total of 6311 people 
      completed the survey. Logistic regression models were constructed to identify 
      independent predictors of reporting high availability of methamphetamine, cannabis, 
      ecstasy and LSD respectively, with low availability of cannabis included as a 
      predictor in the non-cannabis markets. RESULTS: Methamphetamine was reported to be 
      more available than cannabis in all regions. Methamphetamine was more available in 
      towns/rural areas than in cities. Significant predictors of high availability of 
      methamphetamine were living in a town/rural area (OR = 1.38), purchasing from a gang 
      member (OR = 1.88), daily methamphetamine use (OR = 2.41), Maori ethnicity 
      (OR = 1.36) and reporting low availability of cannabis (OR = 1.89). Low availability 
      of cannabis was not a predictor of high availability of ecstasy or LSD. Living in a 
      town/rural area was not a predictor of high availability of cannabis, LSD or 
      ecstasy. Purchasing from a gang member was a predictor of high availability of 
      cannabis (OR = 1.80) and LSD (OR = 4.61). CONCLUSIONS: Further research is required 
      to identify what causal relationships, if any, there are between the statistical 
      associations of high methamphetamine availability, living in a small town, 
      purchasing from a gang, and low cannabis availability. It may be the case that small 
      towns offer an environment where a gang can control the local drugs market.

AB  - Inhibitors of DNA methylation and orexin type-1 receptor antagonists modulate the 
      neurobiological effects driving drugs of abuse and natural reinforcers by activating 
      common brain structures of the mesolimbic reward system. In this study, we applied a 
      self-administration paradigm to assess the involvement of factors regulating DNA 
      methylation processes and satiety or appetite signals. These factors include Dnmts 
      and Tets, miR-212/132, orexins, and orx-R1 genes. The study focused on dopamine 
      projection areas such as the prefrontal cortex (PFCx) and caudate putamen (CPu) and 
      in the hypothalamus (HP) that is interconnected with the reward system. Striking 
      changes were observed in response to both reinforcers, but differed depending on 
      contingent and non-contingent delivery. Expression also differed in the PFCx and the 
      CPu. Cocaine and food induced opposite effects on Dnmt3a expression in both brain 
      structures, whereas they repressed both miRs to a different extent, without 
      affecting their primary transcript in the CPu. Unexpectedly, orexin mRNAs were found 
      in the CPu, suggesting a transport from their transcription site in the HP. The 
      orexin receptor1 gene was found to be induced by cocaine in the PFCx, consistent 
      with a regulation by DNA methylation. Global levels of 5-methylcytosines in the PFCx 
      were not significantly altered by cocaine, suggesting that it is rather their 
      distribution that contributes to long-lasting behaviors. Together, our data 
      demonstrate that DNA methylation regulating factors are differentially altered by 
      cocaine and food. At the molecular level, they support the idea that neural circuits 
      activated by both reinforcers do not completely overlap.

TI  - Genetic determinants of addiction to opioids and cocaine.
PG  - 218-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The completion of the human genome sequence has spurred investigation of 
      the genetic contribution to substance dependence. In this article some of the recent 
      scientific evidence for genetic determinants of opioid and cocaine dependence is 
      reviewed. METHOD: An electronic search of the medical literature was conducted to 
      locate published studies relevant to the genetics of opioid and cocaine dependence. 
      The collected information judged to be most pertinent is described and discussed. 
      RESULTS: Genetic epidemiologic studies support a high degree of heritable 
      vulnerability for both opioid and cocaine dependence. Polymorphisms in the genes 
      coding for dopamine receptors and transporter, opioid receptors, endogenous opioid 
      peptides, cannabinoid receptors, and serotonin receptors and transporter all appear 
      to be associated with the phenotypic expression of this vulnerability once opioids 
      or cocaine are consumed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite this initial progress, identification 
      of specific genes and quantification of associated risk for the expression of each 
      gene remain to be elucidated. While alteration of an individual's genome to change 
      the phenotype seems remote, future interventions for treatment of opioid and cocaine 
      dependence may include precise medications targeted to block the effects of proteins 
      that have been identified through genetic research.

TI  - Factors affecting determination of the optimal ketamine dose for pediatric sedation.
PG  - 119-124
LID - 10.15441/ceem.18.012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Children are sedated before undergoing diagnostic imaging tests in 
      emergency medicine or pediatric sedation anesthesia units. The aim of this study was 
      to identify variables potentially affecting the dose of ketamine required for 
      induction of sedation in pediatric patients undergoing diagnostic imaging. METHODS: 
      This retrospective study included children aged 0 to 18 years who underwent sedation 
      with ketamine for computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in the pediatric 
      sedation anesthesia unit of a tertiary medical center between January 2011 and 
      August 2016. The children's hemodynamic status and depth of sedation were monitored 
      during the examination. We recorded data on demographics, categories of imaging 
      tests, ketamine doses administered, adverse events, respiratory interventions, and 
      duration of sedation. Data for patients who experienced adverse events were 
      excluded. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were included in the final analysis. 
      Univariate linear regression analysis revealed that patient age, height, and body 
      surface area (BSA) affected the sedative dose of ketamine administered. These three 
      variables showed multicollinearity in multivariate linear regression analysis and 
      were analyzed in three separate models. The model with the highest adjusted 
      R-squared value suggested the following equation for determination of the dose of 
      ketamine required to induce sedation: ketamine dose (mg)=-1.62+0.7×age 
      (months)+36.36×BSA (m2). CONCLUSION: Variables such as age and BSA should be 
      considered when estimating the dose of ketamine required for induction of sedation 
      in pediatric patients.

      methylation in coke oven workers.

AB  - Coke oven emissions (COE) containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are 
      predominant toxic constituents of particulate air pollution that have been linked to 
      increased risk of lung cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation is one of the best known 
      epigenetic changes in human cancers and healthy subjects exposed to carcinogens. The 
      purpose of this study is to explore the factors influencing the methylation of long 
      interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) and aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor 
      (AhRR) in coke oven workers. The study population is composed by coke oven workers 
      (348) and water treatment workers (131). And their urinary PAH metabolites were 
      analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography; DNA methylation were measured by 
      pyrosequencing. The urinary PAHs metabolites were significantly elevated in coke 
      oven workers (P < 0.01). The results from multivariate logistic regression analysis 
      showed that a high level of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene was associated with a 
      significantly increased risk of hypomethylation of LINE-1 (OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.25, 
      2.60), and heavy smoking was associated with a significantly increased risk of 
      hypomethylation of AhRR (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.00). Our findings demonstrate 
      that urinary 1-hydroxypyrene may be a useful biomarker for evaluating the role of 
      PAHs exposure on hypomethylation of LINE-1 among coke oven workers and that smoking 
      may be an important factor affecting hypomethylation of AhRR.

TI  - MDMA in humans: factors which affect the neuropsychobiological profiles of 
      recreational ecstasy users, the integrative role of bioenergetic stress.
PG  - 147-63
AB  - Many recreational ecstasy/MDMA users display neuropsychobiological deficits, whereas 
      others remain problem free. This review will investigate some of the drug and 
      non-drug factors which influence the occurrence of these deficits. Acute and chronic 
      MDMA usage are both important. Intensive use within a session is often associated 
      with more problems. In term of lifetime usage, novice users generally remain 
      unimpaired, whereas most heavy users report memory or other psychobiological 
      problems which they attribute to ecstasy. These complaints are confirmed by 
      objective deficits in working memory, attention, frontal-executive, and episodic 
      memory tasks. Psychobiological deficits include disturbed sleep, sexual dysfunction, 
      reduced immuno-competence, and increased oxidative stress. Further MDMA-related 
      factors which may contribute to these changes, include acute and chronic tolerance, 
      and drug dependence. Around 90ñ95% of ecstasy/MDMA users also take cannabis, and 
      this can independently contribute to the adverse neuropsychobiological pro.les; 
      although in some situations the acute co-use of these two drugs may be interactive 
      rather than additive, since cannabis has relaxant and hypothermic properties. 
      Alcohol, nicotine, amphetamine, and other drugs, can also affect the 
      psychobiological pro.les of ecstasy polydrug users in complex ways. Pure MDMA users 
      are rare but they have been shown to display significant neurocognitive deficits. 
      Psychiatric aspects are debated in the context of the diathesis-stress model. Here 
      the stressor of ecstasy polydrug drug use, interacts with various predisposition 
      factors (genetic, neurochemical, personality), to determine the psychiatric outcome. 
      Recreational MDMA is typically taken in hot and crowded dances/raves. Prolonged 
      dancing, feeling hot, and raised body temperature, can also be associated with more 
      psychobiological problems. This is consistent with the animal literature, where high 
      ambient temperature and other metabolic stimulants boost the acute effects of MDMA, 
      and cause greater serotonergic neurotoxicity. In conclusion, the 
      neuropsychobiological effects of MDMA are modulated by a wide range of drug and 
      non-drug factors. These multiple influences are integrated within a bioenergetic 
      stress model, where factors which heighten acute metabolic distress lead to more 
      neuropsychobiological problems.

      polymorphism interacts with Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) and Healthy 
      Eating Index (HEI) to affect hypothalamic hormones and cardio-metabolic risk factors 
      among obese individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies show that cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated 
      transcript prepropeptide (CARTPT) gene polymorphism modifies diet-obesity 
      relationships. However, the interaction between CARTPT gene polymorphism and diet 
      quality indices have not been investigated yet. The current study was aimed to 
      evaluate the interaction between major dietary indices including Diet Quality 
      Index-International (DQI-I) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 and CARTPT gene 
      rs2239670 variants among apparently healthy obese Iranians. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study was carried out by employing 288 apparently healthy obese 
      adults aged 20-50 years with a BMI of 30-40 kg/m(2). Diet quality was evaluated by 
      Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) and Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) 
      using a 132-items semi-quantitative validated food frequency questionnaire. The 
      CARTPT gene rs2239670 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain 
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. Blood 
      concentrations of glycemic markers, lipid profile, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone 
      (MSH) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) were also measured. ANCOVA multivariate 
      interaction model was used to analyze gene-diet interactions. RESULTS: The 
      significant interactions were identified between CARTPT gene polymorphism and HEI, 
      affecting BMR (P(Interaction) = 0.003), serum glucose (P(Interaction) = 0.009) and 
      high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL concentrations (P(Interaction) = 0.03) 
      after adjusting for the effects of sex and age. Also we found gene-diet interaction 
      between CARTPT genotypes and DQI-I in terms of fat mass (FM; P(Interaction) = 0.02), 
      waist circumference (WC; P(Interaction) < 0.001), body mass index (BMI; 
      P(Interaction) < 0.001), basal metabolic rate (BMR, P(Interaction) < 0.001), serum 
      fasting glucose (P(Interaction) < 0.01) and AgRP (P(Interaction) = 0.05) in 
      individuals even after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Current 
      study showed the effects of interaction between CARTPT genotype with adherence to 
      HEI and DQI-I scores on obesity-related anthropometric and metabolic risk-factors.

TI  - The influence of genetic and environmental factors among MDMA users in cognitive 
      performance.

AB  - This study is aimed to clarify the association between MDMA cumulative use and 
      cognitive dysfunction, and the potential role of candidate genetic polymorphisms in 
      explaining individual differences in the cognitive effects of MDMA. Gene 
      polymorphisms related to reduced serotonin function, poor competency of executive 
      control and memory consolidation systems, and high enzymatic activity linked to 
      bioactivation of MDMA to neurotoxic metabolites may contribute to explain variations 
      in the cognitive impact of MDMA across regular users of this drug. Sixty ecstasy 
      polydrug users, 110 cannabis users and 93 non-drug users were assessed using 
      cognitive measures of Verbal Memory (California Verbal Learning Test, CVLT), Visual 
      Memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, ROCFT), Semantic Fluency, and Perceptual 
      Attention (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, SDMT). Participants were also genotyped for 
      polymorphisms within the 5HTT, 5HTR2A, COMT, CYP2D6, BDNF, and GRIN2B genes using 
      polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan polymerase assays. Lifetime cumulative MDMA use 
      was significantly associated with poorer performance on visuospatial memory and 
      perceptual attention. Heavy MDMA users (>100 tablets lifetime use) interacted with 
      candidate gene polymorphisms in explaining individual differences in cognitive 
      performance between MDMA users and controls. MDMA users carrying COMT val/val and 
      SERT s/s had poorer performance than paired controls on visuospatial attention and 
      memory, and MDMA users with CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers performed worse than 
      controls on semantic fluency. Both MDMA lifetime use and gene-related individual 
      differences influence cognitive dysfunction in ecstasy users.

TI  - Mechanisms and environmental factors that underlying the intensification of 
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy)-induced serotonin syndrome in 
      rats.
PG  - 1245-60
LID - 10.1007/s00213-014-3759-z [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Illicit use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) may 
      cause a mild or severe form of the serotonin syndrome. The syndrome intensity is not 
      just influenced by drug doses but also by environmental factors. OBJECTIVES: Warm 
      environmental temperatures and physical activity are features of raves. The purpose 
      of this study was to assess how these two factors can potentially intensify the 
      syndrome. METHODS: Rats were administered MDMA at doses of 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg and 
      examined in the absence or presence of warm temperature and physical activity. The 
      syndrome intensity was estimated by visual scoring for behavioral syndrome and also 
      instrumentally measuring changes in symptoms of the syndrome. RESULTS: Our results 
      showed that MDMA at 3 mg/kg, but not 0.3 or 1 mg/kg, caused a mild serotonin 
      syndrome in rats. Each environmental factor alone moderately intensified the 
      syndrome. When the two factors were combined, the intensification became more severe 
      than each factor alone highlighting a synergistic effect. This intensification was 
      blocked by the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907, competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic 
      acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist CGS19755, autonomic ganglionic blocker 
      hexamethonium, and the benzodiazepine-GABAA receptor agonist midazolam but not by 
      the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 or nicotinic receptor antagonist 
      methyllycaconitine. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that, in the absence of 
      environmental factors, the MDMA-induced syndrome is mainly mediated through the 
      serotonergic transmission (5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)-dependent mechanism) and 
      therefore is relatively mild. Warm temperature and physical activity facilitate 
      serotonergic and other neural systems such as glutamatergic and autonomic 
      transmissions, resulting in intensification of the syndrome (non-5HT mechanisms).

TI  - Preclinical research on cocaine self-administration: environmental determinants and 
      their interaction with pharmacological treatment.
PG  - 717-41
AB  - It has been asserted that any comprehensive understanding of cocaine abuse and its 
      treatment will require attention to both behavioral and pharmacological variables. 
      Although the preclinical literature evaluating the effects of pharmacological 
      variables on cocaine self-administration has been extensively reviewed, no 
      comprehensive review of the effects of environmental variables on cocaine 
      self-administration has been published. The present review summarizes and critiques 
      the preclinical findings on environmental determinants of cocaine 
      self-administration. The influence of environmental variables on the effects of 
      pharmacological interventions on cocaine self-administration are also described. 
      Several environmental variables have been shown to affect cocaine 
      self-administration, including unit dose, schedule of cocaine delivery, schedules of 
      nondrug stimuli, behavioral history, conditioned stimuli, food deprivation, exposure 
      to stress, and rearing environment. Among these variables, unit dose, schedule of 
      cocaine delivery, availability of alternative nondrug reinforcers, food deprivation, 
      and rearing environment have also been shown to alter pharmacological treatment 
      effects on cocaine self-administration. Thus, drug effects on cocaine 
      self-administration are malleable and dependent upon the environmental context 
      within which they occur. Suggestions for future research on the effects of these and 
      other environmental variables on cocaine self-administration and its pharmacological 
      treatment are presented.

TI  - Genetic determinants of cocaine-associated agranulocytosis.
PG  - 240
LID - 10.1186/s13104-015-1219-4 [doi]
LID - 240
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-induced agranulocytosis is a recognized adverse drug event 
      associated with serious infectious complications. Levamisole is an antihelminthic 
      and immunomodulator withdrawn from North American markets in 2005 after reports of 
      agranulocytosis. Previous studies of levamisole, suggest that the human leukocyte 
      antigen (HLA)-B27 confers a genetic predisposition to this adverse drug event. Since 
      2009, emergency room visits due to agranulocytosis in individuals consuming 
      levamisole-adulterated crack-cocaine have increased. METHODS: We performed a 
      case-control study using a genotyping assay and novel gene chip to test the 
      association between cocaine-associated agranulocytosis (CAA) and HLA-B27 and to 
      identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic gene variants associated with the 
      phenotype. RESULTS: Fifty-one CAA cases were identified through a provincial 
      physician reporting system between 2008 and 2011. We examined eight of these cases 
      and 26 matched controls. Genotyping revealed a significant association between 
      HLA-B27 and CAA (odds ratio [OR] 9.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54-54.6). We 
      also observed a similar association with the HLA-B27 tag single nucleotide 
      polymorphism rs4349859 (OR 9.2, 95% CI 1.5-54.6) and rs13202464 (OR 6.7, 95% CI 
      1.1-41). Further associations were identified with variants in the ARBCC12 (OR 10.0, 
      95% CI 2.7-36.8) and CYP11A1 (OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.1-26.6) genes, while a novel 
      protective association was observed with variants in the ARDB1 gene (OR 0.06, 95% CI 
      0.007-0.46). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the association of HLA-B27 with CAA and 
      identified additional susceptibility variants. Health care providers should inform 
      people who are identified as having CAA that it is genetically determined and can 
      recur with continued cocaine use. The severity of infections and subsequent 
      hospitalization, and the risk of recurrence may prompt health-promoting behaviour 
      changes of the affected individuals. These genetic associations warrant the 
      attention of public health and knowledge translation efforts to highlight the 
      implications for susceptibility to this severe adverse drug event.

AB  - Repeated cocaine exposure causes dendritic spine loss in the orbitofrontal cortex, 
      which might contribute to poor orbitofrontal cortical function following drug 
      exposure. One challenge, however, has been verifying links between neuronal 
      structural plasticity and behavior, if any. Here we report that cocaine 
      self-administration triggers the loss of dendritic spines on excitatory neurons in 
      the orbitofrontal cortex of male and female mice (as has been reported in rats). To 
      understand functional consequences, we locally ablated neuronal β1-integrins, cell 
      adhesion receptors that adhere cells to the extracellular matrix and thus support 
      dendritic spine stability. Degradation of β1-integrin tone: 1) caused dendritic 
      spine loss; 2) exaggerated cocaine-seeking responses in a cue-induced reinstatement 
      test; and 3) impaired the ability of mice to integrate new learning into familiar 
      routines - a key function of the orbitofrontal cortex. Stimulating Abl-related gene 
      (Arg) kinase, over-expressing Proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2), and inhibiting 
      Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinase (ROCK) corrected response strategies, 
      uncovering a β1-integrin-mediated signaling axis that controls orbitofrontal 
      cortical function. Finally, use of a combinatorial gene silencing/chemogenetic 
      strategy revealed that β1-integrins support the ability of mice to integrate new 
      information into established behaviors by sustaining orbitofrontal cortical 
      connections with the basolateral amygdala.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCocaine degenerates 
      dendritic spines in the orbitofrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in 
      interlacing new information into established behaviors. One challenge has been 
      verifying links between cellular structural stability and behavior, if any. In this 
      second of two related investigations, we study integrin family receptors, which 
      adhere cells to the extracellular matrix and thereby stabilize dendritic spines (see 
      also DePoy et al., 2019, Journal of Neuroscience). We reveal that β1-integrins in 
      the orbitofrontal cortex control food- and cocaine-seeking behaviors. For instance, 
      β1-integrin loss amplifies cocaine-seeking behavior and impairs the ability of mice 
      to integrate new learning into familiar routines. We identify likely intracellular 
      signaling partners by which β1-integrins support orbitofrontal cortical function and 
      connectivity with the basolateral amygdala.

AB  - Cocaine consumption can induce transient psychotic symptoms, expressed as paranoia 
      or hallucinations. Cocaine induced psychosis (CIP) is common but not developed in 
      all cases. This is the first European study on the relationship between CIP, 
      consumption pattern variables and personality disorders. We evaluated 173 
      cocaine-dependent patients over 18 years; mostly males, whose average age was 33.6 
      years (SD=7.8). Patients attending an outpatient addictions department were enrolled 
      in the study and subsequently systematically evaluated using SCID I and SCID II 
      interviews for comorbid disorders, a clinical interview for psychotic symptoms and 
      EuropASI for severity of addiction. A high proportion of cocaine dependent patients 
      reported psychotic symptoms under the influence of cocaine (53.8%), the most 
      frequently reported being paranoid beliefs and suspiciousness (43.9%). A logistic 
      regression analysis was performed, finding that a model consisting of amount of 
      cocaine consumption, presence of an antisocial personality disorder and cannabis 
      dependence history had 66.2% sensitivity 75.8% specificity predicting the presence 
      of CIP. In our conclusions, we discuss the relevance of evaluating CIP in all 
      cocaine dependent-patients, and particularly in those fulfilling the clinical 
      profile derived from our results. These findings could be useful for a clinical 
      approach to the risks of psychotic states in cocaine-dependent patients.

TI  - Risk Factors of Lower Urinary Tract Syndrome among Ketamine Users.
PG  - 281-286
LID - 10.1111/luts.12178 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the risk factors of ketamine associated-lower 
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as duration of use, dosage of ketamine, 
      co-occurring substance use of other psychoactive drugs, comorbidities, and 
      depression. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional survey. LUTS was assessed with 
      the O'Leary symptom and problem index (OSPI) scores. We included the comorbidities 
      of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) as comorbid factors. 
      Depression was evaluated based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
      Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5). Duration of use, dosage of ketamine and the OSPI 
      scores were subjected to log transformation because of the skewed distribution. 
      RESULT: Among 143 participating ketamine users, 25 (17.5%) had LUTS. Duration of 
      ketamine use was significantly positively correlated with OSPI scores (adjusted β 
      [95% CI], 0.21 [0.06-0.35] in log-log model), which equaled a 10% increase in months 
      of ketamine-use increased OSPI scores by 2.02 %. Female and depression were 
      significantly associated OSPI scores (adjusted β [95% CI], 0.20 [0.03-0.37], 0.49 
      [0.29-0.70], respectively in the log-linear model), with OSPI scores being 1.22 
      times higher in female, and 1.63 times higher in ketamine users with depression. 
      Dosage of use was not significantly associated with OSPI scores (adjusted β [95% 
      CI], 0.04 [-0.12 to 0.20], P = 0.64 in log-log model), likewise with comorbid 
      diseases (adjusted β [95% CI], 0.07 [-0.08 to 0.21], P = 0.36 in log-linear model). 
      CONCLUSION: Depression and longer duration of exposure to ketamine are significantly 
      associated with the development of LUTS among ketamine users. Early evaluation and 
      intervention of depression should be considered in patients of ketamine-associated 
      LUTS.

TI  - HIV, Cocaine Use, and Hepatitis C Virus: A Triad of Nontraditional Risk Factors for 
      Subclinical Cardiovascular Disease.
PG  - 2100-7
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.116.307985 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of 3 
      nontraditional cardiovascular disease risk factors-HIV, cocaine use, and chronic 
      hepatitis C virus infection-with 3 validated markers of subclinical cardiovascular 
      disease: carotid artery plaque, albuminuria, and aortic pulse wave velocity in a 
      well-characterized cohort. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We measured carotid plaque at 
      baseline and after 24 months, urine albumin/creatinine ratio every 6 months, and 
      pulse wave velocity annually for up to 36 months in a predominantly black cohort of 
      292 participants (100 HIV negative and 192 HIV positive). Thirty-nine percent had 
      chronic hepatitis C virus infection and 20%, 28%, and 52% were never, past, and 
      current cocaine users, respectively. Sixteen percent, 47%, and 64% of those with 
      none, 1 or 2, or all 3 nontraditional risk factors had ≥2 abnormal cardiovascular 
      disease risk markers (P=0.001). In fully adjusted models that included all 3 
      nontraditional risk factors, HIV infection was independently associated with carotid 
      plaque progression (increase in the number of anatomic segments with plaque), 
      albuminuria (albumin-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g), albuminuria progression (doubling 
      of albumin-creatinine ratio from baseline to a value >30 mg/g), and pulse wave 
      velocity. Cocaine use was associated with an ≈3-fold higher odds of carotid plaque 
      at baseline, and hepatitis C virus infection was significantly associated with a 
      higher risk of carotid plaque progression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 
      HIV infection, cocaine use, and hepatitis C virus infection are important 
      nontraditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and highlight the need to 
      understand the distinct and overlapping mechanisms of the associations.

TI  - Determinants of cocaine self-administration by laboratory animals.
PG  - 149-61; discussion 161-4
AB  - The reinforcing effect of a drug is that effect that increases the probability that 
      the drug will be self-administered again. Like other drug effects, a reinforcing 
      effect is the result of an interaction between organism, drug and environment. 
      Laboratory research using animal subjects has helped elucidate the contribution of 
      each of these factors to the self-administration of cocaine. A substantial amount of 
      research indicates that increased dopamine neurotransmission in the brain, 
      particularly in mesolimbic and mesocortical regions, plays a major role in cocaine 
      self-administration. Both indirect and direct dopamine agonists can function as 
      positive reinforcers in animals, whereas noradrenergic and serotonergic (5-HT, 
      5-hydroxytryptamine) agonists have not been found to do so. In addition, evidence 
      suggests that dopamine but not noradrenaline (norepinephrine) or serotonin 
      antagonists can attenuate the reinforcing effect of cocaine. Environmental factors 
      have also been shown to be critical determinants of the reinforcing effect of 
      cocaine. The schedule of reinforcement essentially determines the rate and pattern 
      of drug-maintained behaviour. In addition, punishing self-administration, increasing 
      the value of alternative reinforcers that are available, and increasing the cost of 
      cocaine have all been shown to decrease the reinforcing effect of cocaine. With 
      regard to organismic factors, recent research has suggested that there are 
      significant genetic determinants of cocaine consumption. Taken together these 
      research findings in animals imply that certain individuals may be more sensitive to 
      the reinforcing effect of cocaine but that cocaine abuse can be decreased by 
      pharmacological or behavioural means or by a combination of the two.

      was collected from 278 PWUCC in the cities of Bragança and Capanema in northern 
      Brazil. HPV diagnosis and genotyping were performed by a real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction. Logistic regression identified the factors independently associated with 
      oral HPV. RESULTS: In total, 111 (39.9%) PWUCC had HPV DNA. Several genotypes were 
      identified, some of them with high oncogenic potential. Crack-cocaine use ≥40 
      months, unprotected sex, more than 10 sexual partners in the last 12 months, oral 
      sex, exchange of sex for money or illicit drugs, oral mucosa lesions, not having 
      access to public health services, and the absence of vaccination against HPV was all 
      associated with HPV DNA. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified important 
      epidemiological characteristics of oral HPV infection among PWUCC-a highly 
      marginalized risk population-underlining the high prevalence of oral HPV with 
      oncogenic potential and the urgent need for control and prevention measures, 
      especially vaccination against this virus. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: It is necessary to 
      understand the prevalence and risk factors of oral HPV in risk populations as people 
      who use crack-cocaine.

AB  - Cocaine addiction is characterized by alterations in motivational and cognitive 
      processes involved in goal-directed behavior. Recent studies have shown that 
      addictive behaviors can be attributed to alterations in the activity of large 
      functional networks. The aim of this study was to investigate how cocaine addiction 
      affected the left frontoparietal network during goal-directed behavior in a 
      stop-signal task (SST) with reward contingencies by correct task performance. 
      Twenty-eight healthy controls (HC) and 30 abstinent cocaine-dependent patients (ACD) 
      performed SST with monetary reward contingencies while undergoing a functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging scan. The results showed that the left frontoparietal 
      network (FPN) displayed an effect of cocaine addiction depending on reward 
      contingencies rather than inhibition accuracy; and, second, we observed a negative 
      correlation between dependence severity and the modulation of the left FPN network 
      by the monetary reward in ACD. These findings highlight the role of the left FPN in 
      the motivational effects of cocaine dependence.

TI  - Prenatal Cocaine Exposure and Cardiometabolic Disease Risk Factors in 18- to 
      20-Year-Old African Americans.
PG  - 419-26
LID - 10.18865/ed.25.4.419 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The long-term effects of prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) on physical 
      health are largely unknown. No human studies support or refute a relationship 
      between PCE and the long-term risk for cardiovascular and/or metabolic disease. We 
      investigated the association of PCE on primary cardiometabolic disease risk factors 
      in African Americans (AA) aged 18 to 20 years. DESIGN: Cohort, longitudinal, 
      prospective. SETTING: Miami-Dade County, Florida, and the University of Miami Miller 
      School of Medicine/Jackson Memorial Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy full-term 
      inner-city AA adolescents (aged 18 to 20 years, n=350) previously enrolled at birth 
      from 1990-1993. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting serum insulin, glucose, lipids, and 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; systolic and diastolic blood pressures; and the 
      components and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: There were no 
      PCE-associated differences in cardiometabolic disease risk factors including the 
      metabolic syndrome and its individual components in AAs aged 18 to 20 years. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study do not support an association between PCE and 
      increased cardiometabolic disease risk in AAs aged 18 to 20 years. Whether PCE is 
      associated with cardiovascular or metabolic disease in adulthood would require 
      further investigation.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the individual (demographic 
      characteristics, substance-using behaviors, emotional status, and negative outcome 
      expectancy) and peer factors associated with ketamine use in Taiwanese adolescents. 
      A total of 9,860 adolescents completed the self-report questionnaires without 
      omission. Demographic characteristics, substance-using behaviors, emotional status, 
      negative outcome expectancy, and peer factors were compared between the ketamine 
      users and non-users using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Chi-square test, and then 
      significant factors were further selected for stepwise logistic regression analysis 
      to examine the associated factors of ketamine use. Sixty-nine (0.7%) participants 
      reported having used ketamine in the past year. The results of logistic regression 
      analysis indicated that ketamine users were more likely to use marijuana, smoke 
      cigarettes, have peers using illicit drugs, and have a lower level of negative 
      outcome expectancy regarding using ketamine than ketamine non-users. The associated 
      factors found in this study should be taken into consideration when developing 
      prevention and intervention programs for ketamine use in adolescents.

TI  - Psychosocial and behavioral factors related to the post-partum placements of infants 
      born to cocaine-using women.
PG  - 353-66
LID - 10.1016/j.chiabu.2007.12.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: One objective was to determine if cocaine-using women who did not 
      maintain infant custody (NMC) would report more psychological distress, domestic 
      violence, negative coping skills, lower social support and more childhood trauma 
      than cocaine-using women who maintained custody (MC) of their infant. A second 
      objective was to evaluate the relative contribution of psychosocial factors to 
      infant placement. METHODS: Psychosocial profiles of MC women (n=144) were compared 
      with NMC (n=66) cocaine-using women. Subjects were low income, urban, 
      African-American women who delivered an infant at a county teaching hospital. The 
      Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), an assessment of coping strategies (COPE), 
      Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Conflict Tactics Scale 
      (CTS) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were administered. The associations 
      of infant placement status to demographic factors, drug use and psychosocial 
      measures were evaluated. RESULTS: The NMC group reported greater overall 
      psychological distress, psychoticism, somatization, anxiety and hostility than the 
      MC group. The NMC group had more childhood neglect and physical abuse and used more 
      negative coping strategies than the MC group. Lack of prenatal care [OR=.83, CI 
      (.75-.91), p<.0001], heavier prenatal cocaine use [OR=2.55, CI (1.13-4.34), p<.007], 
      greater psychological distress [OR=2.21, CI (1.13-4.34), p<.02] and a childhood 
      history of emotional neglect [OR=1.10, CI (1.02-1.19), p<.02] were associated with 
      increased likelihood of loss of infant custody after control for other substance use 
      and demographic variables. CONCLUSIONS: NMC women have more negative psychological 
      and behavioral functioning post-partum than MC women. Less prenatal care and greater 
      cocaine use, psychological distress and maternal childhood emotional neglect are 
      associated with the post-partum placement of infants born to cocaine-using women. 
      PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Results of this study indicate that poor, urban women who use 
      cocaine prenatally display several measurable differences on psychosocial and 
      behavioral risk factors based on child placement status. Among these risk factors 
      heavier cocaine use, lack of prenatal care, more severe psychological symptoms and 
      early childhood experiences of emotional neglect increase the likelihood of loss of 
      infant custody. Routine, objective assessments of psychosocial and behavioral 
      characteristics of women who use cocaine during pregnancy can aid Child Protective 
      Service workers and clinicians by providing baseline data from which to tailor 
      interventions and set improvement criteria for mother-child reunification.

TI  - Rhythmic Regulation of DNA Methylation Factors and Core-Clock Genes in Brain 
      Structures Activated by Cocaine or Sucrose: Potential Role of Chromatin Remodeling.

AB  - The circadian system interacts with the mesocorticolimbic reward system to modulate 
      reward and memory in a time-of-day dependent manner. The circadian discrimination of 
      reward, however, remains difficult to address between natural reinforcers and drugs 
      of abuse. Circadian rhythms control cocaine sensitization and conversely cocaine 
      causes long-term alteration in circadian periodicity in part through the 
      serotonergic neurotransmission. Since neural circuits activated by cocaine and 
      natural reinforcers do not completely overlap, we compared the effect of cocaine 
      with that of sucrose, a strong reinforcer in rodents, by using passive chronic 
      administration. The expression of fifteen genes playing a major role in DNA 
      methylation (Dnmts, Tets), circadian rhythms (Clock, Bmal1, Per1/2, Cry1/2, 
      Rev-Erbβ, Dbp1), appetite, and satiety (Orexin, Npy) was analyzed in dopamine 
      projection areas like the prefrontal cortex, the caudate putamen, and the 
      hypothalamus interconnected with the reward system. The corresponding proteins of 
      two genes (Orexin, Per2) were examined by IHC. For many factors controlling 
      biological and cognitive functions, striking opposite responses were found between 
      the two reinforcers, notably for genes controlling DNA methylation/demethylation 
      processes and in global DNA methylation involved in chromatin remodeling. The data 
      are consistent with a repression of critical core-clock genes by cocaine, suggesting 
      that, consequently, both agents differentially modulate day/night cycles. Whether 
      observed cocaine and sucrose-induced changes in DNA methylation in a time dependent 
      manner are long lasting or contribute to the establishment of addiction requires 
      further neuroepigenetic investigation. Understanding the mechanisms dissociating 
      drugs of abuse from natural reinforcers remains a prerequisite for the design of 
      selective therapeutic tools for compulsive behaviors.

      ex-moderate users.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although ecstasy is often consumed in the electronic music scene, not 
      everyone with the opportunity to use it chooses to do so. The objective of this 
      study was to understand the reasons for non-use or the cessation of use, which could 
      provide information for public health interventions. METHODS: A qualitative 
      reference method was used. Our "snowball" sample group consisted of 53 people who 
      were split into three subgroups: non-users (NU, n = 23), ex-light users (EX-L, 
      n = 12) and ex-moderate users (EX-M, n = 18). Individual, semi-structured interviews 
      were conducted, transcribed and subjected to content analysis with the aid of 
      NVivo8. RESULTS: Adverse health effects and personal values were given as reasons 
      for non-use in the three groups. Non-users (NU) and ex-light users (EX-L) provided 
      reasons that included fear of possible effects as well as moral, family and 
      religious objections. Ex-moderate users (EX-M) cited reasons related to health 
      complications and concomitant withdrawal from the electronic music scene. However, 
      most of the ex-moderate users did not rule out the possibility of future use. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Potential effects and undesirable consequences appear to guide the 
      decisions within the different groups. Prevention might target these motivations. 
      Individuals who have used ecstasy indicate that social and environmental factors are 
      the most important factors.

AB  - Genetic factors significantly influence addiction-related phenotypes. This is 
      supported by the successful bidirectional selective breeding of two replicate sets 
      of mouse lines for amount of methamphetamine consumed. Some of the same genetic 
      factors that influence methamphetamine consumption have been previously found also 
      to influence sensitivity to the conditioned rewarding and aversive effects of 
      methamphetamine. The goal of the current studies was to determine if some of the 
      same genetic factors influence sensitivity to the conditioned rewarding and aversive 
      effects of cocaine. Cocaine conditioned reward was examined in methamphetamine high 
      drinking and low drinking line mice using a conditioned place preference procedure 
      and cocaine conditioned aversion was measured using a conditioned taste aversion 
      procedure. In addition, a general sensitivity measure, locomotor stimulant response 
      to cocaine, was assessed in these lines; previous data indicated no difference 
      between the selected lines in sensitivity to methamphetamine-induced stimulation. In 
      contrast to robust differences for methamphetamine, the methamphetamine high and low 
      drinking lines did not differ in sensitivity to either the rewarding or aversive 
      effects of cocaine. They also exhibited comparable sensitivity to cocaine-induced 
      locomotor stimulation. These data suggest that the genetic factors that influence 
      sensitivity to the conditioned rewarding and aversive effects of methamphetamine in 
      these lines of mice do not influence sensitivity to these effects of cocaine. Thus, 
      different genetic factors may influence risk for methamphetamine versus cocaine use.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patterns of psychostimulant (PST) use, psychological and physical factors, 
      and family relationships were investigated in a nationally representative sample of 
      adolescents. The differences between users of cocaine (Cc), ecstasy/MDMA, and 
      amphetamine (EA) were analyzed, taking into account gender differences. METHODS: 
      Substance use, psychological factors (lifetime suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts 
      in the previous year, visits to a mental health professional), physical factors 
      (health and body shape perceptions (BSP), body mass index (BMI)), and family 
      relationships (existence of disagreements with parents, relationships with mother 
      and father) were investigated in 26,351 17-year-old French adolescents. RESULTS: 
      Lifetime suicidal behavior was strongly associated with EA use only. Suicidal 
      ideation in the previous year was associated with Cc use among both boys and girls 
      and associated with EA use among girls. Compared to Cc users, more EA users were 
      overweight, while more Cc users were underweight compared to EA users. BSP, BMI, and 
      EA use were related in girls only. Having a good or very good relationship with both 
      mother and father was negatively associated with Cc use in boys and girls. Girls who 
      had a good or very good relationship with their fathers seemed to be less prone to 
      use EA. Boys with a good or very good relationship with their mothers seemed to be 
      less prone to use EA. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study could serve as a 
      basis for prevention and harm reduction strategies/programs targeting youth use and 
      for the adaptation of these strategies/programs according to substance and gender.

AB  - RATIONALE: Repeated social defeat (RSD) increases the rewarding effects of cocaine 
      in adolescent and adult rodents. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to 
      compare the long-term effects of RSD on the conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine 
      and levels of the transcription factors Pitx3 and Nurr1 in the ventral tegmental 
      area (VTA), the dopamine transporter (DAT), the D2 dopamine receptor (D2DR) and 
      precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) signaling pathways, and the 
      tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in adult 
      and adolescent mice. METHODS: Male adolescent and young adult OF1 mice were exposed 
      to four episodes of social defeat and were conditioned 3 weeks later with 1 mg/kg of 
      cocaine. In a second set of mice, the expressions of the abovementioned dopaminergic 
      and proBDNF and TrkB receptor were measured in VTA and NAc, respectively. RESULTS: 
      Adolescent mice experienced social defeats less intensely than their adult 
      counterparts and produced lower levels of corticosterone. However, both adult and 
      adolescent defeated mice developed conditioned place preference for the compartment 
      associated with this low dose of cocaine. Furthermore, only adolescent defeated mice 
      displayed diminished levels of the transcription factors Pitx3 in the VTA, without 
      changes in the expression of DAT and D2DR in the NAc. In addition, stressed adult 
      mice showed a decreased expression of proBDNF and the TrkB receptor, while stressed 
      adolescent mice exhibited increased expression of latter without changes in the 
      former. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that dopaminergic pathways and proBDNF 
      signaling and TrkB receptors play different roles in social defeat-stressed mice 
      exposed to cocaine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We determined the role of risk and protective factors on the 
      trajectories of behavior problems associated with high prenatal cocaine exposure 
      (PCE)/polydrug exposure. METHODS: The Maternal Lifestyle Study enrolled 1388 
      children with or without PCE, assessed through age 15 years. Because most women 
      using cocaine during pregnancy also used other substances, we analyzed for the 
      effects of 4 categories of prenatal drug exposure: high PCE/other drugs (OD), some 
      PCE/OD, OD/no PCE, and no PCE/no OD. Risks and protective factors at individual, 
      family, and community levels that may be associated with behavior outcomes were 
      entered stepwise into latent growth curve models, then replaced by cumulative risk 
      and protective indexes, and finally by a combination of levels of risk and 
      protective indexes. Main outcome measures were the trajectories of externalizing, 
      internalizing, total behavior, and attention problems scores from the Child Behavior 
      Checklist (parent). RESULTS: A total of 1022 (73.6%) children had known outcomes. 
      High PCE/OD significantly predicted externalizing, total, and attention problems 
      when considering the balance between risk and protective indexes. Some PCE/OD 
      predicted externalizing and attention problems. OD/no PCE also predicted behavior 
      outcomes except for internalizing behavior. High level of protective factors was 
      associated with declining trajectories of problem behavior scores over time, 
      independent of drug exposure and risk index scores. CONCLUSIONS: High PCE/OD is a 
      significant risk for behavior problems in adolescence; protective factors may 
      attenuate its detrimental effects. Clinical practice and public health policies 
      should consider enhancing protective factors while minimizing risks to improve 
      outcomes of drug-exposed children.

TI  - Pharmacological and behavioral determinants of cocaine, methamphetamine, 
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and para-methoxyamphetamine-induced hyperthermia.
PG  - 41-52
AB  - RATIONALE: Cocaine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 
      ecstasy), and para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) disrupt normal thermoregulation in 
      humans, with PMA being associated with more severe cases of hyperthermia. Harm 
      minimization advice on how to prevent overheating depends on appropriate 
      thermoregulatory behavior by drug users. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the current 
      study was to establish dose-response relationships for the effects of a number of 
      commonly used illicit stimulants and investigate the behavioral response to 
      increased core temperature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats with 
      telemetry implants were administered either saline or 4, 12, 26, 40 or 80 
      micromol/kg of cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, or PMA and confined to an ambient 
      temperature of 30 degrees C for 30 min, before being able to choose their preferred 
      temperature on a thermally graded runway (11-41 degrees C). RESULTS: The increased 
      core temperature caused by administration of cocaine, methamphetamine, and MDMA 
      treatment led to the animals seeking the cool end of the runway to correct their 
      core temperature, although this did not occur in PMA-treated rats. The order of 
      potency for increasing core temperature was methamphetamine >PMA = MDMA>cocaine. 
      This differed to the slopes of the dose-response curves where MDMA and PMA showed 
      the steepest slope for the doses used followed by methamphetamine then cocaine. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that behavioral aspects of thermoregulation are 
      important in assessing the potential of individual drugs to cause harmful increases 
      in core temperature.

LID - 10.1016/j.addbeh.2009.10.003 [doi]
AB  - Risk perception, perceived behavioral control of obtaining ecstasy (PBC-obtaining), 
      current ecstasy dependence, and recent depression have been associated with past 
      ecstasy use, however, their utility in predicting ecstasy use has not been 
      demonstrated. This study aimed to determine whether these four modifiable risk 
      factors could predict ecstasy use after controlling for socio-demographic covariates 
      and recent polydrug use. Data from 601 ecstasy users in the National Institute on 
      Drug Abuse-funded TriCity Study of Club Drug Use, Abuse and Dependence were analyzed 
      using multivariate logistic regression. Participants were interviewed twice within a 
      2-week period using standardized instruments. Thirteen percent (n = 80) of the 
      participants reported using ecstasy between the two interviews. Low risk perception, 
      high PBC-obtaining (an estimated ecstasy procurement time < 24h), and current 
      ecstasy dependence were statistically associated with ecstasy use between the two 
      interviews. Recent depression was not a significant predictor. Despite not being a 
      target predictor, recent polydrug use was also statistically associated with ecstasy 
      use. The present findings may inform the development of interventions targeting 
      ecstasy users.

TI  - Factors Influencing the Cardiovascular Response to Subanesthetic Ketamine: A 
      Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.
PG  - 909-918
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyx055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing use of ketamine as a potential rapid-onset antidepressant 
      necessitates a better understanding of its effects on blood pressure and heart rate, 
      well-known side effects at higher doses. For the subanesthetic dose used for 
      depression, potential predictors of these cardiovascular effects are important 
      factors influencing clinical decisions. Since ketamine influences the sympathetic 
      nervous system, we investigated the impact of autonomic nervous system-related 
      factors on the cardiovascular response: a genetic polymorphism in the norepinephrine 
      transporter and gender effects. METHODS: Blood pressure and heart rate were 
      monitored during and following administration of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine or 
      placebo in 68 healthy participants (mean age 26.04 ±5.562 years) in a double-blind, 
      randomized, controlled, parallel-design trial. The influences of baseline blood 
      pressure/heart rate, gender, and of a polymorphism in the norepinephrine transporter 
      gene (NET SLC6A2, rs28386840 [A-3081T]) on blood pressure and heart rate changes 
      were investigated. To quantify changes in blood pressure and heart rate, we 
      calculated the maximum change from baseline (ΔMAX) and the time until maximum change 
      (TΔMAX). RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate 
      increased significantly upon ketamine administration, but without reaching 
      hypertensive levels. During administration, the systolic blood pressure at baseline 
      (TP0Sys) correlated negatively with the time to achieve maximal systolic blood 
      pressure (TΔMAXSys, P<.001). Furthermore, women showed higher maximal diastolic 
      blood pressure change (ΔMAXDia, P<.001) and reached this peak earlier than men 
      (TΔMAXDia, P=.017) at administration. NET rs28386840 [T] carriers reached their 
      maximal systolic blood pressure during ketamine administration significantly earlier 
      than [A] homozygous (TΔMAXSys, P=.030). In a combined regression model, both genetic 
      polymorphism and TP0Sys were significant predictors of TΔMAXSys (P<.0005). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Subanesthetic ketamine increased both blood pressure and heart rate 
      without causing hypertensive events. Furthermore, we identified gender and NET 
      rs28386840 genotype as factors that predict increased cardiovascular sequelae of 
      ketamine administration in our young, healthy study population providing a potential 
      basis for establishing monitoring guidelines.

TI  - Association study of 37 genes related to serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission 
      and neurotrophic factors in cocaine dependence.
PG  - 39-46
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12013 [doi]
AB  - Cocaine dependence is a neuropsychiatric disorder in which both environmental and 
      genetic factors are involved. Several processes, that include reward and 
      neuroadaptations, mediate the transition from use to dependence. In this regard, 
      dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission systems are clearly involved in reward and 
      other cocaine-related effects, whereas neurotrophic factors may be responsible for 
      neuroadaptations associated with cocaine dependence. We examined the contribution to 
      cocaine dependence of 37 genes related to the dopaminergic and serotoninergic 
      systems, neurotrophic factors and their receptors through a case-control association 
      study with 319 single nucleotide polymorphisms selected according to genetic 
      coverage criteria in 432 cocaine-dependent patients and 482 sex-matched unrelated 
      controls. Single marker analyses provided evidence for association of the serotonin 
      receptor HTR2A with cocaine dependence [rs6561333; nominal P-value adjusted for age 
      = 1.9e-04, odds ratio = 1.72 (1.29-2.30)]. When patients were subdivided according 
      to the presence or absence of psychotic symptoms, we confirmed the association 
      between cocaine dependence and HTR2A in both subgroups of patients. Our data show 
      additional evidence for the involvement of the serotoninergic system in the genetic 
      susceptibility to cocaine dependence.

TI  - Evaluation of Clinical Factors Associated with Adverse Drug Events in Patients 
      Receiving Sub-Anesthetic Ketamine Infusions.
PG  - 3413-3421
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S217005 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sub-anesthetic ketamine is frequently used as an analgesic to reduce 
      perioperative opioid consumption and has also been shown to have antidepressant 
      effects. Side effects of ketamine include dizziness, diplopia, nystagmus, and 
      psychomimetic effects. It is unclear what clinical factors may be associated with 
      ketamine-related adverse drug events (ADEs). METHODS: We performed a retrospective 
      review of 95 patients who received sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions at our 
      institution. Data examined associations between ketamine-related ADEs and various 
      clinical characteristics including chronic pain, depression, or psychiatric 
      disorder, patient physical characteristics, chronic opioid use, perioperative opioid 
      use, dose and duration of ketamine infusions, pain scores, and perioperative 
      medications such as serotonergic agents, central nervous system (CNS) depressants, 
      and analgesics. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ketamine-related ADEs was 29.5% and 
      the incidence of psychomimetic effects was 14.8%. We observed that patients with a 
      history of depression have a lower incidence of ketamine-related ADEs compared to 
      patients without a history of depression (10.3% vs 37.3%; p value = 0.007). 
      CONCLUSION: Patients with depression were found to have a statistically significant 
      reduction in the incidence of ketamine-related ADEs. We found no statistically 
      significant positive associations between ketamine-related ADEs and other clinical 
      factors such as a history of chronic pain, psychiatric disease, patient physical 
      characteristics, perioperative opioid use, dose of ketamine infusion, or 
      co-administration of other CNS depressants.

TI  - Prevalence of Ecstasy use and predisposing factors among Iranian female high school 
      students.
PG  - 566-71
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine prevalence of ecstasy use and its predisposing factors 
      among Iranian high school female students in Tehran, capital of Iran. METHODS: In 
      this cross-sectional study, 2350 female students of 36 high schools from Tehran, 
      were selected by multi-stage cluster sampling to determine prevalence of ecstasy use 
      and its predisposing factors. SPSS- version 13 was employed to conduct analysis 
      through chi-square, fisher's exact test and logistic regression methods. RESULTS: 
      The prevalence of ecstasy use was 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7-2.9%). Party was the most 
      prevalent place of first use (65%) and access was easy for most users (63%). In 
      multivariate analysis, smoking (P-V = 0.005), alcohol use (P-V = 003), use of other 
      substances (P-V < 0.001), being in relationship with boys (P-V = 0.015), families 
      without one or two parents (P-V = 0.020), night spending at friends home without 
      parents' permission (P-V = 0.001) were associated with ecstasy use. CONCLUSION: Due 
      to relation of ecstasy use with other substances, designed programmes should be 
      comprehensive, with different strategies and collaboration of several sectors. The 
      main strategies are to improve students' health literacy, family support, to limit 
      supply and access, and to legislate appropriate regulatory laws.

AB  - The quantitative analysis of human urinary metabolites as biomarkers in wastewater 
      streams has been used to estimate the rates of illicit drug use in the wider 
      community. The primary underlying assumption in such studies is that a sample of 
      wastewater is equivalent to a cumulative sample of urine. Drug metabolism in humans 
      is predominantly enzymatically mediated, but these processes are not exclusive to 
      the human body, and are found to occur in the environment and the sewer network. 
      Understanding what happens to drugs and their urinary metabolites in the sewer 
      system between the point of excretion and sampling is particularly important since 
      it is possible that in-sewer transformation may influence final biomarker 
      concentration. The present study uses batch experiments to measure and assess the 
      biotransformation processes of cocaine and its two major human metabolites, 
      benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester. The activated sludge modelling framework 
      for xenobiotic organic micro-pollutants (ASM-X) is used for model structure 
      identification and calibration. Biotransformation was observed to follow pseudo 
      first-order kinetics. The biodegradation kinetics of cocaine, benzoylecgonine and 
      ecgonine methyl ester is not significantly affected by the availability of dissolved 
      oxygen. Results obtained in this study show that omitting in-pipe biotransformation 
      affects the accuracy of back-calculated cocaine use estimates. This varies markedly 
      depending on the in-sewer hydraulic retention time, total biomass concentration and 
      the relative concentration of each metabolite. However, back-calculated cocaine use 
      estimates derived from wastewater concentrations of benzoylecgonine and ecgonine 
      methyl ester do show very close agreement if ex-vivo biotransformation of these 
      compounds is considered.

AB  - Nodal-related protein, Ndr2, and transcription factors such as Lmx1b, Otp, Nurr1 and 
      Pitx3 are very important in the differentiation, function and maintenance of 
      mesodiencephalic dopaminergic neurons, and are necessary for the activation of 
      tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine (DA) transporter expression. Hence, the aim 
      of the present work was to evaluate the effects of cocaine on the expression of 
      genes related to the embryogenesis development of the dopaminergic system. Zebrafish 
      embryos were exposed to cocaine hydrochloride at 5h post-fertilization (hpf), and 
      collected at two important stages - 24 and 48hpf - to study the effects of cocaine 
      on the expression of ndr2, the lmx1b.1, lmx1b.2, otpa, otpb, nurr1 transcription 
      factors, and their target genes: TH and DA transporter expression. Our results by 
      qPCR showed that cocaine affects the expression of these genes in different ways, 
      depending on the stage of development. Furthermore by in situ hybridization we 
      observed a change in the spatial distribution of lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2 at both stages 
      (24 and 48hpf) due to exposure to cocaine. We also show the importance of Lmx1b and 
      Otp in th expression through the knockdown of Lmx1b.1 and Lmx1b.2, and of Otpa and 
      Otpb. Additionally, cocaine produced an increase and a decrease in TH levels at 24 
      and at 48hpf, respectively, possibly due to the change in the expression of the 
      transcription factors and ndr2 expression. We conclude that cocaine alters the 
      correct development of dopaminergic system affecting the expression of transcription 
      factors, during the embryogenesis.

TI  - A case-control study of stroke risk factors and outcomes in African American stroke 
      patients with and without crack-cocaine abuse.
PG  - 273-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke in crack-cocaine abusers is increasingly recognized. We aimed to 
      identify significant differences in stroke risk factors, characteristics, and 
      outcomes between hospitalized stroke patients with and without crack-cocaine abuse. 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective study that compared stroke patients with 
      crack-cocaine abuse (cases) to stroke patients without crack-cocaine (controls). 
      RESULTS: We identified 93 crack-cocaine cases and 93 controls admitted between 
      January 2004 and May 2006 to one teaching hospital. There were significant 
      differences between crack-cocaine cases and controls in age (48.7 years vs. 55 
      years) (P = 0.0001), male gender (65.6% vs. 40.9%) (odds ratios, OR = 1.64, 95% CI 
      1.22-2.21), arterial hypertension (61.1% vs. 83.9%) (OR = 0.30, 95% CI 0.15-0.60), 
      hypercholesterolemia (18.7% vs. 68.5%) (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.05-0.21), diabetes 
      (20.9% vs. 41.9%) (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.19-0.70), cigarette smoking (70.6% vs. 29%) 
      (OR = 5.86, 95% CI 3.07-11.20), ischemic stroke (61.3% vs. 79.6%) (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 
      0.21-0.78), and intracerebral hemorrhage (33.3% vs. 17.2%) (OR = 3.03, 95% CI 
      1.53-6.00). Also, there were significant differences in National Institutes of 
      Health Stroke Scale scores (3.3 vs. 7) (P < 0.0001), and MRS scores (1.8 vs. 2.5) (P 
      = 0.0022) at hospital discharge. Using univariable and multivariable logistic 
      regression, we found that crack-cocaine abusers had 2.28 higher odds of having a 
      favorable functional outcome (MRS score ≤ 2) at hospital discharge, after adjusting 
      for stroke risk factors and characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that 
      crack-cocaine abusers with stroke had fewer traditional risk factors, and more 
      favorable functional outcome as compared to non-crack-cocaine abusers.

AB  - Reduced eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 (eIF2)α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α) enhances 
      protein synthesis, memory formation, and addiction-like behaviors. However, p-eIF2α 
      has not been examined with regard to psychoactive cannabinoids and 
      cross-sensitization. Here, we find that a cannabinoid receptor agonist (WIN 55,212-2 
      mesylate [WIN]) reduced p-eIF2α in vitro by upregulating GADD34 (PPP1R15A), 
      the recruiter of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The induction of GADD34 was linked to 
      ERK/CREB signaling and to CREB-binding protein (CBP)-mediated histone 
      hyperacetylation at the Gadd34 locus. In vitro, WIN also upregulated eIF2B1, an eIF2 
      activator subunit. We next found that WIN administration in vivo reduced p-eIF2α in 
      the nucleus accumbens of adolescent, but not adult, rats. By contrast, WIN increased 
      dorsal striatal levels of eIF2B1 and ΔFosB among both adolescents and adults. In 
      addition, we found cross-sensitization between WIN and cocaine only among 
      adolescents. These findings show that cannabinoids can modulate eukaryotic 
      initiation factors, and they suggest a possible link between p-eIF2α and the gateway 
      drug properties of psychoactive cannabinoids.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) overdiagnosis and a pharmacological 
      attempt to increase cognitive performance, are the major causes for the frequent 
      (ab)use of psychostimulants in non-ADHD individuals. Methylphenidate is a 
      non-addictive psychostimulant, although its mode of action resembles that of 
      cocaine, a well-known addictive and abused drug. Neuronal- and glial-derived growth 
      factors play a major role in the development, maintenance and survival of neurons in 
      the central nervous system. We hypothesized that methylphenidate and cocaine 
      treatment affect the expression of such growth factors. Beginning on postnatal day 
      (PND) 14, male Sprague Dawley rats were treated chronically with either cocaine or 
      methylphenidate. The rats were examined behaviorally and biochemically at several 
      time points (PND 35, 56, 70 and 90). On PND 56, rats treated with cocaine or 
      methylphenidate from PND 14 through PND 35 exhibited increased hippocampal 
      glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mRNA levels, after 21 withdrawal days, 
      compared to the saline-treated rats. We found a significant association between 
      cocaine and methylphenidate treatments and age progression in the prefrontal protein 
      expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Neither treatments affected 
      the behavioral parameters, although acute cocaine administration was associated with 
      increased locomotor activity. It is possible that the increased hippocampal GDNF 
      mRNA levels, may be relevant to the reduced rate of drug seeking behavior in ADHD 
      adolescence that were maintained from childhood on methylphenidate. BDNF protein 
      level increase with age, as well as following stimulant treatments at early age may 
      be relevant to the neurobiology and pharmacotherapy of ADHD.

TI  - Factors associated with initiation of ecstasy use among US adolescents: findings 
      from a national survey.
PG  - 193-8
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.08.020 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To investigate adolescent pathways to ecstasy use by (1) examining how early 
      onsets of smoking, drinking, and marijuana use are related to a child's risk of 
      initiation of ecstasy use and (2) assessing the influence of other individual and 
      parental factors on ecstasy use initiation. METHODS: Data on 6426 adolescents (12-17 
      years old at baseline) from the National Survey of Parents and Youth (NSPY), a 
      longitudinal, nationally representative household survey of youth and their parents, 
      were used in the analyses. Information on youth substance use, including ecstasy 
      use, as well as familial and parental characteristics, was available. RESULTS: 
      Initiation of ecstasy use is predicted by an adolescent's early initiation of 
      smoking, drinking, or marijuana use. In particular, early initiation either of 
      marijuana use, or of both smoking and drinking, increases a child's risk for ecstasy 
      use initiation. Among the familial and parental variables, parent drug use emerged 
      as significantly predictive of child initiation of ecstasy use; living with both 
      parents and close parental monitoring, on the other hand, are negatively associated 
      with ecstasy use initiation, and may be protective against it. At the individual 
      level, sensation seeking tendencies and positive attitudes towards substance use, as 
      well as close associations with deviant peers, are predictive of adolescent 
      initiation of ecstasy use. CONCLUSION: Our findings on the risk and protective 
      factors for initiation of ecstasy use, especially with regard to factors that are 
      modifiable, will be useful for prevention programs targeting youth use not only of 
      ecstasy, but also of other drugs.

TI  - Novel transcription factors are induced by chronic cocaine treatment.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - There are many other transcription factors that are regulated by cocaine, and there 
      are several nontranscriptional mechanisms of regulating protein levels as well. 
      However, the induction of the chronic AP-1 complex and the chronic Fras provides a 
      mechanism capable of underlying long-lasting alterations in gene expression 
      following chronic cocaine treatment. We hypothesize that while the well-known acute 
      effects of cocaine are occurring, the acutely induced cAMP pathway, possibly in 
      conjunction with other second messenger pathways, is also inducing two general types 
      of alterations in gene expression. 1. Acutely induced significant alterations in 
      gene expression are rapidly induced and relatively short-lived. These alterations in 
      gene expression would allow the cell to rapidly adapt to cocaine in its environment 
      without committing to long-term changes. 2. Additional alterations in gene 
      expression are induced by each acute administration during chronic cocaine exposure. 
      These latter alterations are gradually induced and long-lasting. With each acute 
      activation, the level of induction of these latter longer-lasting alterations in 
      gene expression would be relatively small and insignificant compared to the rapidly 
      induced acute alterations in gene expression. Therefore, with each acute 
      administration, the cell does not commit itself to long-term alterations. However, 
      these small but longer lasting changes in gene expression would accumulate with each 
      acute administration during chronic cocaine treatment, similar to the accumulation 
      of the chronic AP-I complex (FIG. 4). The cumulative alterations which occur during 
      repeated administrations eventually reach a level where they produce significant and 
      long-lasting alterations in gene expression different from those induced acutely. 
      This incremental induction of long-lasting alterations in gene expression would 
      allow the cell to gradually commit to long-term alterations for the purpose of 
      adapting to repeated long-term exposure to cocaine in its environment. These 
      long-lasting alterations in gene expression may underlie the gradual induction of 
      persistent changes in protein levels, neuronal signaling, and related behaviors. 
      This hypothesis allows for the different adaptations observed following acute versus 
      chronic cocaine administration at the biochemical, physiological, and behavioral 
      levels. We hope these investigations provide ideas for specific pharmacological 
      blockade or reversal of the long-term, versus short-term, alterations in gene 
      expression that lead to addiction, without interfering with the animal's or human's 
      ability to experience reward. This would be important for ensuring both efficacy and 
      compliance.

TI  - Problematic versus non-problematic ecstasy/MDMA use: the influence of drug usage 
      patterns and pre-existing psychiatric factors.
PG  - 417-24
AB  - Recreational ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) use has been 
      increasingly associated with a number of psychiatric symptoms and psychological 
      problems. However, previous studies assessing possible psychopathological effects 
      have not identified whether users consider their ecstasy use "problematic" or not. 
      In addition, research has generally failed to address the potential role of 
      premorbid psychiatric status. This study aimed to assess whether premorbid 
      psychiatric history and/or patterns of ecstasy use would be associated with the 
      degree of self-reported problems attributable to ecstasy. Problematic ecstasy users 
      (n = 53) who had reported problems attributable to their ecstasy use were compared 
      with non-problematic ecstasy users (n = 62), polydrug controls (n = 62) and illegal 
      drug-naive controls (n = 111) on a recreational drug use questionnaire; a 
      questionnaire, which ascertained personal and family psychiatric histories, and the 
      Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Problematic ecstasy users exhibited significantly 
      higher scores on a number of dimensions of the BSI compared to illegal drug-naive 
      and/or polydrug controls. Problematic ecstasy users also exhibited significantly 
      elevated scores on somatization, depression, anxiety and negative psychobiology 
      compared to non-problematic ecstasy users. BSI scores for the non-problematic 
      ecstasy users did not differ from polydrug or illegal drug-naive controls. 
      Problematic ecstasy users reported significantly higher levels of ecstasy use, 
      including lifetime consumption, average dosage and binge consumption compared to 
      non-problematic ecstasy users. Additionally, a greater number of problematic ecstasy 
      users reported personal and family psychiatric histories compared to controls and 
      non-problematic ecstasy users. This study demonstrates two distinct ecstasy using 
      groups: non-problematic ecstasy users who are not showing signs of psychopathology 
      and problematic ecstasy users who are showing evidence of a range of symptoms. This 
      data therefore partially supports the link between ecstasy dosage and negative 
      psychological sequelae, but highlights the importance of the need to consider 
      ecstasy-related attributions, pre-existing mental health status and vulnerability.

TI  - Factors associated with the initiation of cocaine and heroin among problem drug 
      users: reflections on interventions.
PG  - 933-47
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study identifies self-reported factors facilitating initiation of 
      cocaine and heroin among young problem users in Amsterdam to enable interventions to 
      be targeted at issues personally relevant for this population. METHOD: A qualitative 
      study using in-depth interviews to obtain retrospective drug use histories. 
      Recruitment took place both directly (by street outreach, outreach at methadone 
      outposts) and indirectly (by respondent-driven sampling). The study started in the 
      year 2001 and included 50 problem drug users, aged 18-30, of whom 72% were male, 64% 
      were polydrug users, and 36% were homeless. RESULTS: The seven most common 
      self-reported factors facilitating initiation of cocaine and heroin are desire for 
      affect regulation, drug availability, curiosity, desire to be part of a group, 
      misinformation, desire for energy, and starting because it has a depressant effect. 
      CONCLUSION: Some factors perceived to facilitate initiation of cocaine and/or heroin 
      revealed in this study are hardly addressed by current prevention programs and could 
      inform future initiatives. Programs can be targeted at young people who we 
      identified to be at high risk. Research using quantitative methods is likely to be 
      valuable in determining the relative importance of mentioned factors for different 
      groups of young people. The study's limitations are noted.

AB  - The goal was to identify factors that predicted sustained cocaine abstinence and 
      transitions from cocaine use to abstinence over 24 months. Data from baseline 
      assessments and multiple follow-ups were obtained from three studies of continuing 
      care for patients in intensive outpatient programs (IOPs). In the combined sample, 
      remaining cocaine abstinent and transitioning into abstinence at the next follow-up 
      were predicted by older age, less education, and less cocaine and alcohol use at 
      baseline, and by higher self-efficacy, commitment to abstinence, better social 
      support, lower depression, and lower scores on other problem severity measures 
      assessed during the follow-up. In addition, higher self-help participation, 
      self-help beliefs, readiness to change, and coping assessed during the follow-up 
      predicted transitions from cocaine use to abstinence. These results were stable over 
      24 months. Commitment to abstinence, self-help behaviors and beliefs, and 
      self-efficacy contributed independently to the prediction of cocaine use 
      transitions. Implications for treatment are discussed.

TI  - [Factors connected with efficacy of single ketamine infusion in bipolar depression].
PG  - 35-47
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of single ketamine infusion 
      and clinical and biochemical factors connected with such efficacy, in patients with 
      bipolar depression, which had not improved on antidepressant treatment. METHODS: The 
      study included 42 patients (32 women, 10 men), aged 22-67 years, with bipolar 
      depression. They received > or = 1 mood-stabilizing medications of first and/or 
      second generation. After discontinuation of antidepressants (> or = 7 days), 
      intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg body weight) was performed. The 
      assessment of depression by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was made 
      before, and after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days following administration of ketamine. The 
      assumed criterion for clinical improvement was the reduction of > or = 50% score on 
      the Hamilton scale after 7 days. In a subgroup of 20 patients, prior to 
      administration of ketamine, serum concentrations of homocysteine, vitamin B12, folic 
      acid, neurotrophins and inflammatory proteins were measured. RESULTS: In the whole 
      group, the severity of depression on the Hamilton scale decreased significantly 24 
      hours after administration of ketamine from 22.6 +/- 5.1 to 15.6 +/- 7.4 points. 
      After 7 days it was 13 +/- 7 and after 14 days - 11.8 +/- 7.8 points. Patients 
      showing clinical improvement (n = 22) had significantly higher frequency of alcohol 
      addiction and family history of alcoholism. Biochemical tests in the subset of 20 
      patients demonstrated that those with clinical improvement (n = 10) had higher serum 
      concentrations of vitamin B12 and receptor-1 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor 
      before administration of ketamine. Ketamine infusion was well tolerated. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm a rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine infusion 
      maintaining for 2 weeks, in a considerable proportion of patients with bipolar 
      depression, and good clinical tolerance of such procedure. Also, some clinical and 
      biochemical factors associated with ketamine efficacy were shown.

AB  - RATIONALE: Current evidence and literature reviews provide a strong justification 
      for examining the orexin receptor (OXR) system as a therapeutic target in substance 
      use disorders, including cocaine and other psychostimulants. OBJECTIVES: In this 
      preliminary, proof-of-concept examination of orexin modulation in humans with 
      cocaine use disorder, we measured changes in domains tied to relapse: stress, sleep, 
      cue reactivity, and inhibitory control. Additionally, mood symptoms (anxiety, 
      depression), medication compliance, and side effects were assessed. METHODS: Twenty 
      non-treatment seeking subjects with cocaine use disorder (CUD) received either the 
      OX(1)R / OX(2)R antagonist suvorexant PO or placebo at 10 PM daily for two weeks 
      (10 mg week 1, 20 mg week 2). Using psychometrics, smart-watch actigraphy, a 
      cold-pressor stress challenge, and eye-tracking technology, the following domains 
      were examined: sleep, stress/anxiety, cue-reactivity (attentional bias, craving), 
      and inhibitory control. Psychometric data were collected every M/W/F (7 time 
      points). Laboratory data were collected weekly (3 time points). RESULTS: Bayesian 
      and frequentist generalized linear models were employed in parallel to examine the 
      effects of suvorexant compared to placebo, with a Bayesian posterior probability 
      threshold >80% as evidence of a signal for suvorexant. Notable results favoring 
      suvorexant over placebo included fewer total anti-saccade errors, improved sleep 
      actigraphy (sleep/awake periods), pre/post cold-pressor change in heart rate and 
      salivary cortisol (all posterior probabilities >94%), and craving (posterior 
      probability >87%). CONCLUSIONS: Initial but restricted evidence is provided 
      supporting the orexin system as a modulator of relapse-related processes in cocaine 
      use disorder. Baseline differences in the main outcome variables were not 
      experimentally controlled and differences in craving were observed at baseline. 
      This, in combination with a limited sample size, constrain the nature of the 
      project. The results may serve to inform more comprehensive future research.

TI  - Demographic and psychological factors associated with lifetime cocaine use: An 
      exploratory factor analysis of baseline questionnaires.
PG  - 70-77
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Underlying heterogeneity among individuals with cocaine dependence is 
      widely postulated in the literature, however, identification of a group of factors 
      that explain risk of cocaine use severity has yet to be confirmed. METHODS: Latent 
      mixture modeling evaluated 338 cocaine-dependent individuals recruited from the 
      community to assess the evidence for the presence of distinct subgroups. Variables 
      included 5 baseline questionnaires measuring cognitive function (Shipley), 
      impulsivity (BIS), mood (BDI), affective lability (ALS), and addiction severity 
      (ASI). Results failed to suggest multiple subgroups. Given a lack of evidence for 
      discrete latent classes, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) followed by 
      exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) was implemented to identify 
      functional dimensions to enhance interpretation of these variables. RESULTS: 
      Findings from the EFA indicated a 3-factor model as the best fit, and the subsequent 
      ESEM solution resulted in associations with lifetime cocaine use. Factor 1, best 
      characterized by demographic factors (gender, age), is associated with less lifetime 
      cocaine use. Psychological problems best characterize factor 2, which is associated 
      with higher lifetime cocaine use. Finally, factor 3 is characterized by other 
      substance use (alcohol and marijuana). Although this factor did not demonstrate a 
      statistically reliable relation with self-reported, lifetime cocaine use, it did 
      indicate a potentially meaningful positive association. CONCLUSIONS: These 3 factors 
      delineate dimensions of functioning that likewise help characterize the variability 
      found in previously established associations with self-reported cocaine use.

TI  - Fluoxetine and cocaine induce the epigenetic factors MeCP2 and MBD1 in adult rat 
      brain.
PG  - 487-92
AB  - Once bound to methylated CpG sites, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is thought 
      to silence transcription of downstream genes by recruiting a histone deacetylase 
      (HDAC). Mutations within the MeCP2 gene have been found to cause Rett syndrome, a 
      disorder of arrested neuronal development. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that 
      Mecp2, as well as the methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD1, were significantly induced in 
      normal adult rat brain after repeated injections of fluoxetine or cocaine for 10 
      days (one injection per day). Mecp2 was not induced by repeated injections of 
      1-(2-bis(4-fluorphenyl)-methoxy)-ethyl)-4-(3-phenyl-propyl)piperazine (GBR-12909) or 
      nortriptyline. Together, the data indicate that the serotonergic system is 
      predominantly involved. Using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction experiments, MBD1 mRNA and both Mecp2_e1 and Mecp2_e2 transcripts were 
      found to be induced by fluoxetine. Induction of the methylbinding proteins was 
      accompanied with enhanced HDAC2 labeling intensity and mRNA synthesis in response to 
      fluoxetine. In tandem, acetylated forms of histone H3 were found to be decreased. 
      The effect was characterized in three serotonin projection areas, the 
      caudate-putamen, the frontal cortex, and the dentate gyrus subregion of hippocampus. 
      Our data highlight GABAergic neurons as major target cells expressing Mecp2 in 
      response to the serotonin-elevating agents and suggest that serotonin signaling 
      enhances gene silencing in postmitotic neurons.

TI  - Adverse Drug Effects and Preoperative Medication Factors Related to Perioperative 
      Low-Dose Ketamine Infusions.
PG  - 482-7
LID - 10.1097/AAP.0000000000000416 [doi]
AB  - High-dose opioid administration is associated with significant adverse events. 
      Evidence suggests that low-dose ketamine infusions improve perioperative analgesia 
      over conventional opioid management, but usage is highly variable. Ketamine's 
      adverse drug effects (ADEs) are well known, but their prevalence during low-dose 
      infusions in a clinical setting and how often they lead to infusion discontinuation 
      are unknown. The purposes of this study were 3-fold: (1) to identify patient factors 
      associated with initiation of ketamine infusions during spine surgery, (2) to 
      identify specific spine procedures in which ketamine has been used most frequently, 
      and (3) to identify ADEs associated with postoperative ketamine infusions and which 
      ADEs most frequently led to discontinuation. Spine surgery was chosen because of its 
      association with moderate to severe pain and a relatively high use of ketamine 
      infusions in this population at our hospital.

TI  - Factors associated with patient-reported procedural memory following emergency 
      department procedural sedation with ketamine and propofol: A prospective cohort of 
      563 patients.
PG  - 200-208
LID - 10.1111/1742-6723.12884 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the proportion of patients reporting procedural memory 
      following procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) with ketamine and propofol (KP) 
      administered premixed together (ketofol) or individually (sequential KP) in ED 
      attendees. Identify any clinical or demographic variables associated with procedural 
      memory. METHODS: This was a convenience sample of 563 patients who received KP PSA 
      as per the departmental protocol. A standardised script was used to assess for 
      procedural memory. This was categorised as 'any' and 'unpleasant' prior to discharge 
      (immediate memory) and at telephone follow up (delayed memory). RESULTS: A total of 
      318 patients had sequential KP and 249 premixed 1:1 ketofol. For sequential KP 
      compared to ketofol, the proportion reporting any memory was as follows: 3.5% versus 
      3.3% immediate, 4.4% versus 5.5% delayed and 5.4% versus 7.4% for the sum of these. 
      For unpleasant memory, the proportion was as follows: 1.6% versus 2.9% immediate, 
      1.7% versus 4.7% delayed and 2.2% versus 6.9% all unpleasant memory (odds ratio [OR] 
      3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-8.1). Memory was associated with male sex (OR 
      4, 95% CI 1.5-10.5), opiates (OR 3, 95% CI 1.7-7.5), a Wisconsin Sedation Scale 
      score ≥3 (moderate sedation) (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.1-18.2) and propofol dose <0.75 mg/kg 
      compared to >0.75 mg/kg (13% versus 3%) (OR 6, 95% CI 1.7-21). The ketofol group had 
      5% (95% CI 0.1-10) more respiratory events requiring intervention. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Procedural memory was uncommon for both mix types; however, a greater proportion of 
      the premixed ketofol group had unpleasant memory. Associations with sex, opiates, 
      moderate sedation and propofol dose were identified, and respiratory adverse events 
      were more common in the premixed ketofol group.

AB  - Environmental stimuli associated with drug use can take on conditioned properties 
      capable of promoting drug-seeking behaviors during abstinence. This study 
      investigated the relative importance of the amount of reinforced responding, number 
      of cocaine-stimulus pairings, total cocaine intake, and reinforcing effectiveness of 
      the self-administered dose of cocaine to the conditioned reinforcing effectiveness 
      of cocaine-associated stimuli (CS). Male rats were trained to self-administer 
      cocaine (0.1 [small] or 1.0mg/kg/inf [large]) under a fixed ratio schedule of 
      reinforcement. A progressive ratio (PR) schedule was used to quantify the 
      reinforcing effectiveness of each dose of cocaine, as well as the conditioned 
      reinforcing effectiveness of the CS following treatment with saline or the dopamine 
      D2-like receptor agonist pramipexole (0.1-3.2mg/kg). The large dose of cocaine 
      maintained larger final ratios and greater levels of cocaine intake, whereas the 
      small dose resulted in more cocaine-CS pairings. The total amount of responding was 
      comparable between groups. During PR tests of conditioned reinforcement, pramipexole 
      increased responding for CS presentations in both groups; however, the final ratio 
      completed was significantly greater in large- as compared to small-dose group. In 
      addition to highlighting a central role for dopamine D2-like receptors in modulating 
      the effectiveness of cocaine-paired stimuli to reinforce behavior, these results 
      suggest that conditioned reinforcing effectiveness is primarily determined by the 
      reinforcing effectiveness of the self-administered dose of cocaine and/or total 
      cocaine intake, and not the total amount of responding or number cocaine-stimulus 
      pairings. These findings have implications for understanding how different patterns 
      of drug-taking might impact vulnerability to relapse.

TI  - Sedation effects of intranasal dexmedetomidine combined with ketamine and risk 
      factors for sedation failure in young children during transthoracic 
      echocardiography.
PG  - 77-84
LID - 10.1111/pan.13529 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sedation is often required for young children during transthoracic 
      echocardiography. Dexmedetomidine and ketamine are two sedatives that are commonly 
      used in children for procedural sedation, but they have some disadvantages when they 
      are used alone. AIMS: The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the effects 
      and safety of intranasal sedation with a combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine 
      during transthoracic echocardiography in young children and to analyze risk factors 
      for sedation failure. METHODS: After IRB approval, we retrospectively evaluated data 
      on patients who underwent echocardiography between May 2016 and August 2017 
      utilizing a combination of dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg and ketamine 1 mg/kg. We 
      collected information including heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation, sedation onset 
      time, exam time, recovery time, and adverse reactions. Stepwise logistic regression 
      analyses were performed to analyze the risk factors for sedation failure. RESULTS: 
      Sedation was successful in 2212 patients (96%) and took effect in 15.7 (IQR: 10-23) 
      min, while sedation failed in 92 patients. Cyanotic heart disease, history of 
      sedation failure, history of congenital heart disease surgery, and fever were 
      independent risk factors for sedation failure. Most of the patients in this study 
      had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade of II to III, but no severe 
      adverse reactions were observed. CONCLUSION: Intranasal sedation with a combination 
      of dexmedetomidine and ketamine is effective and appears to have an acceptable 
      safety profile for young children during transthoracic echocardiography.

TI  - Factors associated with help seeking and perceived dependence among cocaine users.
PG  - 81-91
AB  - Motivational and decisional models suggest that those who seek help for substance 
      use problems may differ from those who do not seek help in terms of their belief 
      that substance use is creating social and personal negative consequences and their 
      perceived dependence. In this study, help seeking for cocaine use was hypothesized 
      to be a function of the negative consequences from cocaine, perceiving oneself as 
      dependent on cocaine, quantity and frequency of use, cost of use, and route of 
      administration. A sample of 161 substance abusers in treatment who had used any 
      cocaine in the last 6 months completed questionnaires regarding the quantity, 
      frequency, history, and perceptions of the consequences of their cocaine use. Of the 
      161 subjects, 113 (70.2%) had at some time sought help from someone for their 
      cocaine use. After controlling for marital and employment status, a logistic 
      regression revealed that the number of negative consequences experienced, feeling 
      dependent on cocaine, and the amount of cocaine used were associated with seeking 
      help for cocaine use. Additionally, a logistic regression was performed to determine 
      factors associated with cocaine users' reporting that they feel dependent on 
      cocaine. Significant variables included number of negative consequences experienced 
      and frequency of use. Consistent with motivational and decisional models, results 
      suggest that clients' motivation to seek help for cocaine use is related primarily 
      to adverse consequences of use. Theoretical and clinical implications of results are 
      discussed.

TI  - Risk factors in the relationship between gender and crack/cocaine.
PG  - 165-75
AB  - Female inner-city substance users evidence greater crack/cocaine use and are more 
      likely to be dependent on this drug than on any other drug. Additionally, female 
      inner-city substance users evidence greater crack/cocaine use and are more likely to 
      be dependent on this drug than their male counterparts, despite no consistent 
      difference demonstrated in use and dependence across other drugs. Because no 
      published work has empirically examined the factors underlying this link between 
      females and crack/cocaine, the current study examined the role of theoretically 
      relevant personality and environmental variables. Among 152 (37% female) individuals 
      in a residential substance-use treatment program, females evidenced greater use of 
      crack/cocaine (current and lifetime heaviest) and were significantly more likely to 
      evidence crack/cocaine dependence than their male counterparts. In contrast, no 
      gender differences were found for any other substance across alcohol, cannabis, and 
      hallucinogens (including PCP). Surprisingly, females were more impulsive than their 
      male counterparts, with impulsivity serving as a risk factor in the relationship 
      between gender and crack/cocaine dependence and lifetime heaviest use. Females also 
      evidenced higher levels of negative emotionality and childhood abuse, but neither 
      variable served as a risk factor in the relationship between gender and 
      crack/cocaine dependence or use. Limitations and future directions are discussed, 
      including the need for further exploration of impulsivity across its various 
      dimensions as well as the inclusion of additional variables such as social context 
      variables to account more fully for this complex link between gender and 
      crack/cocaine.

TI  - Gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) concentrations in humans and factors affecting 
      endogenous production.
PG  - 9-16
AB  - The endogenous nature of the drug of abuse gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) has 
      caused various interpretative problems for toxicologists. In order to obtain data 
      for the presence of endogenous GHB in humans and to investigate any factors that may 
      affect this, a volunteer study was undertaken. The GHB concentrations in 119 urine 
      specimens from GHB-free subjects and 25 urine specimens submitted for toxicological 
      analysis showed maximal urinary GHB concentrations of 3mg/l. Analysis of 15 plasma 
      specimens submitted for toxicological analysis detected no measurable GHB (less than 
      2.5mg/l). Studies in a male and female volunteer in which different dietary food 
      groups were ingested at weekly intervals, showed significant creatinine-independent 
      intra-individual fluctuation with overall urine GHB concentrations between 0 and 
      2.55, and 0 and 2.74mg/l, respectively. Urinary concentrations did not appear to be 
      affected by the particular dietary groups studied. The concentrations measured by 
      gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography 
      with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) lend further support to the proposed urinary and 
      plasma interpretative cut-offs of 10 and 4mg/l, respectively, where below this it is 
      not possible to determine whether any GHB detected is endogenous or exogenous in 
      nature.

TI  - Gender and social rejection as risk factors for engaging in risky sexual behavior 
      among crack/cocaine users.
PG  - 376-84
LID - 10.1007/s11121-013-0406-6 [doi]
AB  - Crack/cocaine and engagement in risky sexual behavior represent important 
      contributors to the escalation of the HIV infection among women. Several lines of 
      research have emphasized the role of social factors in women's vulnerability for 
      such practices and stressed the importance of understanding such factors to better 
      inform prevention efforts and improve their effectiveness and efficiency. However, 
      few studies have attempted to pinpoint specific social/contextual factors 
      particularly relevant to high-risk populations such as female crack/cocaine users. 
      Extensive previous research has related the experience of social rejection to a 
      variety of negative outcomes including, but not limited to, various forms of 
      psychopathology, self-defeating, and self-harm behavior. Motivated by this research, 
      the current study explored the role of laboratory-induced social rejection in 
      moderating the relationship between gender and risky sexual behavior among a sample 
      of crack/cocaine users (n = 211) at high risk for HIV. The results showed that among 
      women, but not among men, experiencing social rejection was significantly associated 
      with a greater number of sexual partners. Further, experiencing social rejection was 
      not related to the frequency of condom use. Implications for future research, 
      prevention, and treatment are discussed.

TI  - Traditional risk factors and acute myocardial infarction in patients hospitalized 
      with cocaine-associated chest pain.
PG  - 290-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cocaine causes coronary artery constriction and may cause acute 
      myocardial infarction (AMI). The role of traditional coronary risk factors in 
      cocaine-associated myocardial infarction is unclear. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized 
      that traditional risk factors play a major role in predicting AMI in patients 
      admitted with cocaine-associated chest pain METHODS: After reviewing 165 admissions 
      for chest pain in patients with a history of recent cocaine use and/or a positive 
      drug screen from January 2001 to December 2004, we identified 151 patients with 
      information available on at least 6 of the following 7 risk factors: gender, 
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, family history of coronary artery 
      disease (CAD) and known CAD. AMI was diagnosed using WHO criteria. A risk score was 
      calculated on the basis of the number of risk factors, gender and age. Association 
      of AMI was evaluated with the individual risk factors and with the risk score. 
      RESULTS: AMI was identified in 21 patients (14%). All patients diagnosed with AMI 
      were smokers. Continuous risk score (p < 0.0001), highest vs. lowest quartile of 
      risk score (p = 0.007), known CAD, age, hyperlipidemia and family history of CAD 
      were individually associated with the diagnosis of AMI (p>or=0.05). Each quartile of 
      risk score was associated with increased odds of the diagnosis of AMI and score of 8 
      or higher was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Several traditional risk 
      factors are associated with the diagnosis of AMI among patients hospitalized with 
      cocaine-associated chest pain and increasing risk factor score was associated with 
      increasing odds of AMI diagnosis.

TI  - Subacute effects of ecstasy on mood: an exploration of associated risk factors.
PG  - 53-61
LID - 10.1177/0269881112463467 [doi]
AB  - Ecstasy use may result in lowered mood, anxiety or aggression in the days following 
      use. Yet, few studies have investigated what factors increase the risk of 
      experiencing such symptoms. Ecstasy users (at least once in the last 12 months) who 
      subsequently took ecstasy (n=35) over the period of one week, were compared on 
      measures of mood, sleep, stress and drug use, with those who abstained from ecstasy 
      (n=21) that week. Measures were administered the week prior to ecstasy use and one 
      and three days following use, or the equivalent day for abstainers. Mood symptoms 
      were assessed using the Kessler-10 self-report psychological distress scale, a 
      subjective mood rating (1-10), and using the depression, anxiety and hostility items 
      from the clinician-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Timeline Followback methods 
      were used to collect information on drug use and life stress in the past month. 
      Self-reported sleep quality was also assessed. Ecstasy use was not associated with 
      subacute depressive, anxiety or aggressive symptoms. Rather, lowered mood and 
      increased psychological distress were associated with self-reported hours and 
      quality of sleep obtained during the three-day follow-up. These findings highlight 
      the importance of considering sleep disruption in understanding the short-term mood 
      effects of ecstasy use.

TI  - Cocaine induces a differential dose-dependent alteration in the expression profile 
      of immediate early genes, transcription factors, and caspases in PC12 cells: a 
      possible mechanism of neurotoxic damage in cocaine addiction.
PG  - 482-90
AB  - Cocaine is a widely used drug of abuse and psychostimulant that acts on the central 
      nervous system by blocking the dopamine reuptake sites. PC12 cells, a rat 
      pheochromocytoma clonal line, in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), multiply 
      and differentiate into competent neurons that can synthesize, store, and secrete the 
      neurotransmitter dopamine (DA). In the present study, we evaluated the effect of 
      increasing doses of cocaine on the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs), c-fos 
      and c-jun, and closely related transcription factors, SP-1 and NF-kbeta, at 24 h 
      after the exposure to cocaine (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2500 microM) in 
      NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Cocaine (50-500 microM) resulted in significant 
      induction of the expression of c-fos, c-jun, SP-1, and NF-kbeta. However, higher 
      concentrations of cocaine (1000 and 2500 microM) resulted in the downregulation of 
      these expressions after 24 h. To further understand the role of dose-dependent 
      changes in the mechanisms of cell death, we evaluated the protein expression of 
      apoptotic markers. A concentration-dependent increase in the expression of caspase-9 
      and -3 was observed up to 500 microM cocaine. However, the higher dose did not show 
      any expression. We also evaluated the effect of increasing doses of cocaine on DA 
      concentration and the expression of dopamine transporter (DAT). A significant 
      dose-dependent decrease in the concentration of DA as well as the expression of DAT 
      was observed 24 h after the exposure of PC12 cells to cocaine. Therefore, in the 
      present study, we reported that cocaine has both upstream and downstream regulatory 
      actions on some IEGs and transcription factors that can regulate the mechanism of 
      cell death, and these effects on gene expression are independent of its action on 
      the dopaminergic system.

TI  - Molecular determinants of cocaine block of human ether-á-go-go-related gene 
      potassium channels.
PG  - 865-74
AB  - The use of cocaine causes cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Blockade of the 
      cardiac potassium channel human ether-á-go-go-related gene (hERG) has been 
      implicated as a mechanism for the proarrhythmic action of cocaine. hERG encodes the 
      pore-forming subunits of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K(+) channel 
      (I(Kr)), which is important for cardiac repolarization. Blockade of I(Kr)/hERG 
      represents a common mechanism for drug-induced long QT syndrome. The mechanisms for 
      many common drugs to block the hERG channel are not well understood. We investigated 
      the molecular determinants of hERG channels in cocaine-hERG interactions using 
      site-targeted mutations and patch-clamp method. Wild-type and mutant hERG channels 
      were heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. We found that 
      there was no correlation between inactivation gating and cocaine block of hERG 
      channels. We also found that consistent with Thr-623, Tyr-652, and Phe-656 being 
      critical for drug binding to hERG channels, mutations in these residues 
      significantly reduced cocaine-induced block, and the hydrophobicity of the residues 
      at position 656 dictated the cocaine sensitivity of the channel. Although the S620T 
      mutation, which removed hERG inactivation, reduced cocaine block by 21-fold, the 
      S620C mutation, which also completely removed hERG inactivation, did not affect the 
      blocking potency of cocaine. Thus, Ser-620 is another pore helix residue whose 
      mutation can interfere with cocaine binding independently of its effect on 
      inactivation.

TI  - Ketamine inhibits transcription factors activator protein 1 and nuclear 
      factor-kappaB, interleukin-8 production, as well as CD11b and CD16 expression: 
      studies in human leukocytes and leukocytic cell lines.
PG  - 934-41
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181c95cfa [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent data indicate that ketamine exerts antiinflammatory actions. 
      However, little is known about the signaling mechanisms involved in ketamine-induced 
      immune modulation. In this study, we investigated the effects of ketamine on 
      lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of transcription factors activator protein 1 
      (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in human leukocyte-like cell lines and 
      in human blood neutrophils. METHODS: Electric mobility shift assays were used to 
      investigate ketamine's effects on nuclear binding activity of both transcription 
      factors in U937 cells, and a whole blood flow cytometric technique was used for AP-1 
      and NF-kappaB determination in leukocytes. Cell lines with different expression 
      patterns of opioid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors were used for reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction to investigate receptors involved in 
      ketamine signaling. Ketamine's effect on interleukin-8 production was assessed in a 
      whole blood assay. RESULTS: Ketamine inhibited both transcription factors in a 
      concentration-dependent manner. These effects did not depend on opiate or 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Ketamine also reduced interleukin-8 production in 
      whole blood and expression of CD11b and CD16 on neutrophils. CONCLUSION: The 
      immunoinhibitory effects of ketamine are at least in part caused by inhibition of 
      transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1, which regulate production of 
      proinflammatory mediators. However, signaling mechanisms different from those 
      present in the central nervous system are responsible for ketamine-mediated 
      immunomodulation.

TI  - Latent classes of heroin and cocaine users predict unique HIV/HCV risk factors.
PG  - 220-7
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.10.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patterns of heroin and cocaine use vary and may be associated with 
      unique risk factors for bloodborne infections. METHODS: Latent class analysis 
      identified sub-populations of 552 heroin and cocaine users in Baltimore, Maryland. 
      Using latent class regression, these classes were analyzed for associations with 
      demographic characteristics, risky behaviors, Hepatitis C, and HIV. RESULTS: Three 
      classes were found: Crack/Nasal-Heroin users (43.5%), Polysubstance users (34.8%), 
      and Heroin Injectors (21.8%). Compared to Polysubstance users, Crack/Nasal-Heroin 
      users were almost 7 times more likely to identify as Black (OR=6.97, 95% 
      CI=4.35-11.2). Sharing needles was over 2.5 times more likely among Polysubstance 
      users than among Heroin Injectors (OR=2.66, 95% CI=1.49-4.75). Crack/Nasal-Heroin 
      users were 2.5 times more likely than Polysubstance users to exchange drugs for sex 
      (OR=2.50, 95% CI=1.22-5.13). Crack/Nasal-Heroin users were less likely than Heroin 
      Injectors to have Hepatitis C (OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.06-0.18), but no significant 
      differences were found for HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Subpopulations of cocaine and heroin 
      users differed in demographic classifications, HIV-risk behaviors, and Hepatitis C 
      infection. All subpopulations included substantial numbers of HIV-positive 
      individuals. Findings provide further evidence that non-injection drug users face 
      significant infectious disease risk.

AB  - We assessed mortality risk factors and excess mortality compared to the general 
      population in two Spanish sub-cohorts of 8,825 cocaine and heroin users (CHUs) and 
      11,905 only cocaine users (OCUs) aged 15-49 admitted to drug treatment. Heroin use 
      (among all cocaine users), no-regular employment and drug injection (among CHUs and 
      OCUs), daily cocaine use and previous drug treatment (among CUs), and death before 
      2005 and >10 years of heroin use (among CHUs) were clearly associated with higher 
      mortality in Cox regression. Excess mortality was assessed by the directly 
      standardized mortality rate ratio, which was higher in CHUs (14.3; 95% CI: 
      12.6-16.2) than CUs (5.1; 95% CI: 4.3-6.0) and in women than men, especially among 
      OCUs (8.6; 95% CI: 7.5-10.0 vs. 3.5; 95% CI: 3.3-3.8); it decreased with age among 
      CHUs, but did not decrease overall during 1997-2008. OCUs excess mortality was

TI  - Risk factors for cocaine-induced paranoia in cocaine-dependent sibling pairs.
PG  - 77-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cocaine-induced paranoia (CIP), an irrational intense suspicion of 
      others, is a common manifestation of cocaine dependence. Both environmental and 
      genetic factors are thought to play a role, but the specific nature of such 
      contributions is poorly understood. METHODS: Demographic, diagnostic, and 
      cocaine-use data were obtained from 420 cocaine-dependent, genetically confirmed, 
      full-sibling pairs (N=840 subjects) interviewed with the Semi-Structured Assessment 
      for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA). Probands with and without CIP were 
      compared; then, factors associated with sibling CIP status were analyzed by logistic 
      regression. Alcohol dependence, a known heritable phenotype, was analyzed as a 
      positive control. RESULTS: Of 420 probands, 273 (65%) experienced CIP. Probands with 
      CIP were more severely dependent upon cocaine, had an earlier age of onset, were 
      more likely to smoke cocaine, and used cocaine less frequently during the preceding 
      year. Independent analyses of siblings replicated two of the former (i.e., 
      dependence severity and age of onset). Probands with CIP also had a 
      non-significantly higher proportion of siblings with the trait (66% versus 59%). 
      Probands with concurrent alcohol dependence were confirmed to have significantly 
      higher rates of alcoholism among their siblings. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of cocaine 
      dependence and age of onset appear to be important risk factors for CIP. Concordance 
      for CIP between siblings did not emerge as significant in our analyses.

TI  - The pharmacokinetic determinants of the frequency and pattern of intravenous cocaine 
      self-administration in rats by pharmacokinetic modeling.
PG  - 254-61
AB  - We investigated the pharmacokinetic determinants of the frequency of intravenous 
      cocaine self-administration in 2.5-h sessions. Two groups of rats were implanted 
      with dual catheters that permitted cocaine infusion and blood sampling via the 
      femoral and jugular vein catheters, respectively. Half of the animals in each group 
      self-administered one of the two cocaine unit doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg/infusion) by 
      pressing a lever under a continuous schedule of reinforcement. To monitor serum 
      cocaine concentrations, the remaining animals received concurrent, 
      response-independent infusions whenever the matched animals self-administered 
      cocaine infusions. Multiple concentration-time data in two successive 
      self-administrations were determined to monitor the extent of fluctuation in 
      concentrations by pharmacokinetic modeling. Behavioral analyses revealed the higher 
      unit dose (1 mg/kg) resulted in less frequent cocaine self-administration, and a 
      longer interinfusion interval, whereas the total doses were similar for the two 
      groups (24.5-27.0 mg/kg/2.5 h). Cocaine decayed biexponentially. Both the values of 
      clearance and terminal elimination rate constant for the self-administration 
      paradigm were significantly greater than those after the bolus cocaine dosing series 
      (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, separated by 3 days). The regularity in cocaine 
      self-administration produced relatively stable serum cocaine concentrations that 
      oscillated between maximum (C(max)) and minimum (C(min)) values regardless of dose 
      size and interinfusion interval. Although the C(max) for the 1-mg/kg unit dose (1.47 
      microg/ml) was significantly higher than that for the 0.5-mg/kg dose (0.82 
      microg/ml), the C(min) values between the groups approximated each other (0.28, and 
      0.34 microg/ml, respectively). Hence, the C(min) is the determinant of the 
      initiation of the next drug-taking behavior.

TI  - Environmental and pharmacological factors in the development of noncontingent 
      tolerance to cocaine in pigeons.
PG  - 266-82
LID - 10.1037/a0016682 [doi]
AB  - Previous research with rats and monkeys has shown that tolerance to behavioral 
      effects of cocaine developed if the drug was administered before behavioral test 
      sessions but not if it was administered after sessions, a finding known as 
      contingent tolerance. In contrast, a recent experiment using pigeons found that they 
      showed tolerance resulting from postsession drug administration (noncontingent 
      tolerance). The 4 experiments reported in this article were conducted to examine 
      that result more fully. Experiment 1 found that immediate presession administration 
      of cocaine to pigeons reliably led to tolerance to effects on food-reinforced 
      operant key pecking and that immediate postsession administration of cocaine also 
      led to tolerance in half the subjects, those whose key pecking was not suppressed by 
      postsession dosing. Experiment 2 showed that eating in the home cage under the 
      effects of postsession cocaine was not necessary for tolerance to develop to effects 
      of postsession cocaine and that the majority of subjects developed tolerance from 
      postsession cocaine administration. Experiment 3 found that mere drug exposure in 
      the home cage without exposure to an experimental session did not reliably produce 
      tolerance during the behavioral session. Experiment 4 showed that tolerance from 
      postsession cocaine administration could be observed even when daily dosing was 
      discontinued during dose-response curve assessment. Therefore, the combined results 
      showed that pigeons often developed tolerance to effects of cocaine during the 
      behavioral session when cocaine was administered postsession and that this tolerance 
      was not the result of feeding under effects of the drug.

TI  - Motivational factors in cocaine pharmacotherapy trials with methadone-maintained 
      patients: problems and paradoxes.
PG  - 205-12
AB  - Phamacotherapy trials for cocaine abuse among methadone-maintained patients have 
      typically reported negative findings as well as high rates of cocaine use during the 
      trial. The contribution of motivational factors to these results is a potentially 
      important, under investigated area. This article points out that some 
      methadone-maintained patients may enter a trial for cocaine abuse with little desire 
      for treatment, motivated primarily to continue receiving methadone or to avoid 
      program sanctions for continued cocaine use. Participants in clinical trials may 
      constitute a phase delaying discharge in a cyclic pattern of multiple treatment 
      episodes. Testing a pharmacologic agent in a motivationally inappropriate sample may 
      not provide a good estimate of the agent's effectiveness. In view of the important 
      public health role that methadone maintenance programs play in preventing HIV 
      transmission, and the subversion of this role by intravenous cocaine use, solutions 
      to these problems are urgently needed. The authors suggest several possible 
      approaches, including pre- and posttreatment motivation assessment, as well as the 
      inclusion of psychosocial interventions that provide the context for the emergence 
      of potential medication effects.

TI  - Factors associated with optimal pharmacy refill adherence for antiretroviral 
      medications and plasma HIV RNA non-detectability among HIV-positive crack cocaine 
      users: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 455
LID - 10.1186/s12879-016-1749-y [doi]
LID - 455
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crack cocaine use is known to contribute to poor adherence to 
      antiretroviral medications; however, little is known about facilitators of or 
      barriers to effective HIV treatment use among HIV-infected crack cocaine users. We 
      sought to identify correlates of optimal pharmacy refill adherence for 
      antiretroviral medications and plasma HIV RNA viral load (pVL) suppression among 
      this population. METHODS: Data from a prospective cohort of HIV-positive people who 
      use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada, were linked to comprehensive HIV clinical 
      monitoring and pharmacy dispensation records. We used multivariable generalized 
      linear mixed-effects modelling to longitudinally identify factors associated with 
      ≥95 % adherence to pharmacy refills for antiretroviral medications and pVL <50 
      copies/mL among crack cocaine users exposed to highly-active antiretroviral therapy 
      (HAART). RESULTS: Among 438 HAART-exposed crack cocaine users between 2005 and 2013, 
      240 (54.8 %) had ≥95 % pharmacy refill adherence in the previous 6 months at 
      baseline. In multivariable analyses, homelessness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.58), 
      ≥daily crack cocaine smoking (AOR: 0.64), and ≥ daily heroin use (AOR: 0.43) were 
      independently associated with optimal pharmacy refill adherence (all p < 0.05). The 
      results for pVL non-detectability were consistent with those of medication 
      adherence, except that longer history of HAART (AOR: 1.06), receiving a single 
      tablet-per-day regimen (AOR: 3.02) and participation in opioid substitution 
      therapies was independently associated with pVL non-detectability (AOR: 1.55) (all 
      p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Homelessness, and daily crack cocaine and/or heroin use were 
      independently and negatively associated with optimal HAART-related outcomes. With 
      the exception of opioid substitution therapies, no addiction treatment modalities 
      assessed appeared to facilitate medication adherence or viral suppression. 
      Evidence-based treatment options for crack cocaine use that also confer benefits to 
      HAART need to be developed.

AB  - Cocaine is associated with a wide array of complications through a number of 
      different mechanisms. Although the majority of cocaine-related morbidity has been 
      attributed to complications in arterial vasculature, the deleterious impact of 
      venous complications appears to be largely unrepresented in current literature as 
      well as clinical practice despite emerging evidence of the high prevalence and 
      annual incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in illicit drug users. Our case 
      report illustrates an uncharacteristic presentation of cocaine-related widespread 
      thrombotic cascade involving both arterial and venous circulations causing 
      significant morbidity. The complex pathophysiology of widespread prothrombotic state 
      caused by cocaine includes endothelial damage promoting the increase of fibrinogen 
      and Von Willebrand factor to platelet aggregation and clot formation. It is 
      important to identify the impact cocaine-induced venous thrombosis can mount, 
      especially in the form of potentially fatal complications like pulmonary embolism. 
      Although recent studies have focused on increased incidence and prevalence of venous 
      thrombosis in the setting of cocaine abuse, ours is the first case of a documented 
      pulmonary embolism caused by cocaine-related venous thrombosis. Further studies are 
      needed to identify patients at higher risk for this complication like rare 
      thrombotic disorders.

TI  - Factors that lead to the use of crack cocaine in combination with marijuana in 
      Brazil: a qualitative study.
PG  - 706

LID - 706
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Brazil, crack cocaine use remains a healthcare challenge due to the 
      rapid onset of its pleasurable effects, its ability to induce craving and addiction, 
      and the fact that it is easily accessible. Delayed action on the part of the 
      Brazilian Government in addressing the drug problem has led users to develop their 
      own strategies for surviving the effects of crack cocaine use, particularly the drug 
      craving and psychosis. In this context, users have sought the benefits of combining 
      crack cocaine with marijuana. Our aim was to identify the reasons why users combine 
      crack cocaine with marijuana and the health implications of doing so. METHODS: The 
      present study is a qualitative study, using in-depth interviews and criteria-based 
      sampling, following 27 crack cocaine users who combined its use with marijuana. 
      Participants were recruited using the snowball sampling technique, and the point of 
      theoretical saturation was used to define the sample size. Data were analyzed using 
      the content analysis technique. RESULTS: The interviewees reported that the 
      combination of crack cocaine use with marijuana provided "protection" (reduced 
      undesirable effects, improved sleep and appetite, reduced craving for crack cocaine, 
      and allowed the patients to recover some quality of life). CONCLUSIONS: Combined use 
      of cannabis as a strategy to reduce the effects of crack exhibited several 
      significant advantages, particularly an improved quality of life, which "protected" 
      users from the violence typical of the crack culture. Crack use is considered a 
      serious public health problem in Brazil, and there are few solution strategies. 
      Within that limited context, the combination of cannabis and crack deserves more 
      thorough clinical investigation to assess its potential use as a strategy to reduce 
      the damage associated with crack use.

TI  - Cocaine use and hypertension are major risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage in 
      young African Americans.
PG  - 311-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in 
      African Americans aged 18 to 45 years. African Americans are at a higher risk for 
      ICH than Whites, particularly in the younger age groups. However, few data are 
      available regarding the factors that contribute to the high risk of ICH among 
      younger African Americans. DESIGN: A case-control study. SETTINGS: A 
      university-affiliated public hospital. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and twenty-two 
      African-American patients admitted with non-traumatic ICH to Grady Memorial Hospital 
      (Atlanta, Ga.) and 366 age- and sex matched African-American controls selected from 
      a nationally representative sample of the civilian, non-institutionalized US 
      population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Association between ICH and various demographic 
      and clinical factors determined by stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Cocaine 
      use (OR 6.1, 95% CI 3.3-11.8), hypertension (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3.2-8.7) and alcohol use 
      (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3) were independently associated with increased risk for ICH. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine use, hypertension and alcohol use contributed to the high risk 
      of ICH observed in younger African Americans. Primary preventive strategies are 
      required to reduce the high frequency of modifiable risk factors predisposing 
      younger African Americans to ICH.

TI  - Specificity of genetic and environmental risk factors for symptoms of cannabis, 
      cocaine, alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine dependence.
PG  - 1313-20
AB  - CONTEXT: Although genetic risk factors have been found to contribute to dependence 
      on both licit and illicit psychoactive substances, we know little of how these risk 
      factors interrelate. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the structure of genetic and 
      environmental risk factors for symptoms of dependence on cannabis, cocaine, alcohol, 
      caffeine, and nicotine in males and females. DESIGN: Lifetime history by structured 
      clinical interview. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Four thousand eight 
      hundred sixty-five members of male-male and female-female pairs from the Virginia 
      Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders. Main Outcome Measure 
      Lifetime symptoms of abuse of and dependence on cannabis, cocaine, alcohol, 
      caffeine, and nicotine. RESULTS: Controlling for greater symptom prevalence in 
      males, genetic and environmental parameters could be equated across sexes. Two 
      models explained the data well. The best-fit exploratory model contained 2 genetic 
      factors and 1 individual environmental factor contributing to all substances. The 
      first genetic factor loaded strongly on cocaine and cannabis dependence; the second, 
      on alcohol and nicotine dependence. Nicotine and caffeine had high 
      substance-specific genetic effects. A confirmatory model, which also fit well, 
      contained 1 illicit drug genetic factor--loading only on cannabis and cocaine--and 1 
      licit drug genetic factor loading on alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. However, these 
      factors were highly intercorrelated (r = + 0.82). Large substance-specific genetic 
      effects remained for nicotine and caffeine. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of genetic and 
      environmental risk factors for psychoactive substance dependence was similar in 
      males and females. Genetic risk factors for dependence on common psychoactive 
      substances cannot be explained by a single factor. Rather, 2 genetic factors-one 
      predisposing largely to illicit drug dependence, the other primarily to licit drug 
      dependence-are needed. Furthermore, a large proportion of the genetic influences on 
      nicotine and particularly caffeine dependence appear to be specific to those 
      substances.

TI  - Reasons for stimulant use among Latino gay men in San Francisco: a comparison 
      between methamphetamine and cocaine users.
PG  - i71-8
AB  - The literature on drug-using gay men has documented a strong relationship between 
      methamphetamine (MA) use and high-risk sexual practices. Of particular concern is 
      that MA use is associated with powerful sexual effects that may facilitate the 
      transmission of HIV. As a group, Latino gay men show high risk for HIV infection, 
      and such risk has been related to episodes of sex under the influence of drugs. 
      However, little information exists about stimulant use among Latino gay men, and it 
      is not known whether MA use in this population is similarly motivated by sexual 
      effects. This study reports reasons for stimulant use in a sample of 300 Latino gay 
      men randomly selected from social and sexual venues; only men who reported stimulant 
      use in the last 6 months were included in the study. Of stimulant users, 51% (n=153) 
      reported MA, 44% (n=133) reported cocaine, and 5% (n=14) reported crack as their 
      "most frequently used stimulant" (MFS); reasons for use were assessed for the 
      participant's specific MFS. Reasons for stimulant use clustered by five main 
      factors, including energy, sexual enhancement, social connection, coping with 
      stressors, and focused work productivity. MA users gave reasons more frequently 
      related to sexual enhancement (to have better sex, more sex, and more anal sex) 
      whereas cocaine users gave reasons more often related to social connections (to be 
      more sociable and to fit in with other gay men). These findings suggest that Latino 
      gay men use stimulants for reasons that are important in their social, emotional, 
      work, and sexual lives. Like non-Latino Whites, Latino gay men were found to rely on 
      MA for reasons related to sexual enhancement, possibly to meet cultural expectations 
      and norms of sexual prowess and sexual success in the gay community.

TI  - Cocaine use and other suspected risk factors for obsessive-compulsive disorder: a 
      prospective study with data from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area surveys.
PG  - 281-95
AB  - Using prospectively gathered epidemiologic data, we sought to estimate the degree to 
      which the risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder might be elevated among adults 
      actively using cocaine, with and without illicit use of marijuana or other 
      controlled substances. Study subjects were selected in 1980-84 by taking probability 
      samples of adult household residents at five sites of the Epidemiologic Catchment 
      Area (ECA) Program: New Haven, Connecticut; Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis, 
      Missouri; Durham-Piedmont, North Carolina; Los Angeles, California. Soon after 
      sampling at baseline, a total of 18,572 participants completed standardized 
      interviews to measure suspected risk factors (including illicit drug use) and to 
      evaluate whether they had met diagnostic criteria for currently or formerly active 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as other mental disorders. The 
      interviews were re-administered 1 year later to identify incident cases among 13,306 
      at-risk participants, 414 being active cocaine users. After sorting these 
      participants into strata defined by age and census tract of household residence and 
      after excluding persons found at baseline to have active or prior OCD, we found 105 
      incident cases of OCD within 103 of the age-matched and residence-matched strata, 
      which also contained a total of 514 subjects who had not developed OCD. Applying 
      standard epidemiologic strategies presented in prior ECA research reports, we 
      performed conditional multiple logistic regression to estimate the risk of OCD for 
      active cocaine users versus non-users. We also performed unconditional multiple 
      logistic regression to estimate OCD risk for the 414 active cocaine users versus the 
      12,892 participants not using cocaine. Both of these epidemiologic strategies 
      yielded consistent results: subjects actively using cocaine and also marijuana were 
      found to be at increased risk for OCD. Under the conditional model, the estimated 
      relative risk was 7.2 (P = 0.03), while the value from unconditional regression was 
      4.1 (P = 0.01). Active users of cocaine almost always were active users of marijuana 
      or some other controlled substance, so it was not possible to estimate a relative 
      risk value for subjects using cocaine only. Nonetheless, if replicated, this 
      epidemiologic test of the cocaine-OCD hypothesis warrants attention in laboratory 
      and clinical research, as do other suspected risk factors identified in the study, 
      including sex (being female), employment status (not working for pay) and a prior 
      history of distinct psychiatric disorders such as alcohol dependence, affective 
      disorders and phobic disorders.

TI  - Clinical determinants of cognition levels in French cocaine addicted patients.
PG  - 4086-96
AB  - Cocaine has become a public health problem. Several studies have shown that cocaine 
      addiction is associated with multiple cognitive damages, such as memory, inhibitory 
      control, attention and executive functions. A French cohort of cocaine addicted 
      patients was divided into two groups: CCU (Current cocaine users) and abstainers. 
      Their cognitive abilities were compared to a control group and associations with 
      clinical determinants were assessed. The CCU group and the abstainers had episodic 
      memory, working memory and inhibitory control disabilities compared to the control 
      group. Both the CCU and the abstainers group had the same cognitive abilities but 
      their clinical determinants for these cognitive abilities differed. In the CCU 
      group, exposure to cocaine seemed to have a negative impact on cognition especially 
      inhibitory control, memory and impulsivity. In the abstainers group, craving and 
      depression impeded cognition.

TI  - Factors associated with difficulty accessing crack cocaine pipes in a Canadian 
      setting.
PG  - 890-6

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Crack cocaine pipe sharing is associated with various 
      health-related harms, including hepatitis C transmission. Although difficulty 
      accessing crack pipes has been found to predict pipe sharing, little is known about 
      the factors that limit pipe access in settings where pipes are provided at no cost, 
      albeit in limited capacity. Therefore, we investigated crack pipe access among 
      people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected 
      through two Canadian prospective cohort studies. Generalised estimating equations 
      with logit link for binary outcomes were used to identify factors associated with 
      difficulty accessing crack pipes. RESULTS: Among 914 participants who reported using 
      crack cocaine, 33% reported difficulty accessing crack pipes. In multivariate 
      analyses, factors independently associated with difficulty accessing crack pipes 
      included: sex work involvement [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.57; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 1.03-2.39], having shared a crack pipe (AOR = 1.69; 95% CI: 
      1.32-2.16), police presence where one buys/uses drugs (AOR = 1.47; 95% CI: 
      1.10-1.95), difficulty accessing services (AOR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.31-2.32) and health 
      problems associated with crack use (AOR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.04-1.79). Reasons given 
      for difficulty accessing pipes included sources being closed (48.2%) and no one 
      around selling pipes (18.1%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion 
      of people who smoke crack cocaine report difficulty accessing crack pipes in a 
      setting where pipes are available at no cost but in limited quantity. These findings 
      indicate the need for enhanced efforts to distribute crack pipes and address 
      barriers to pipe access.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for LSD use among young women.
PG  - 67-75
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To report the lifetime prevalence of lysergic acid diethylamide 
      (LSD) and to identify unique correlates of using this substance in the last year 
      among a large multiethnic sample of sexually active adolescent and young adult women 
      aged 14 to 26 yrs. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional survey, 
      administered at university-based ambulatory reproductive health clinics, was 
      completed by 904 women between April and November of 1997 to identify risk factors 
      associated with their use of LSD within the past 12 months. Subjects who reported 
      lifetime, but not past 12 months', use of marijuana, LSD, or other illicit drugs 
      were excluded, leaving a sample of 368 nonusers and 56 users of LSD. In addition, 
      231 young women who reported only using marijuana in the last year were used as a 
      comparison group to identify unique factors associated with LSD use. RESULTS: Of the 
      total sample (n=904), 13% (n=119) reported lifetime use of LSD, and 58% (n=536) 
      reported lifetime use of marijuana. Logistic regression analyses controlling for age 
      and race/ethnicity found distinct profiles for those who reported using LSD or only 
      marijuana in the last year when compared to those who reported no substance use. 
      Common to both groups was reporting being drunk at least 10 times during the last 
      year, regular smoking of at least half a pack of cigarettes, and identification as a 
      high-sexual-risk taker. However, LSD users as compared to nonusers were more likely 
      to report white ethnicity (as compared to nonwhite), be less than or equal to 17 
      years of age (as compared to at least 18 years), report a history of physical abuse, 
      and be categorized as having severe depressive symptomatology. In contrast, those 
      who reported only using marijuana were more likely to report single marital status, 
      young age at first intercourse, having half or more of their friends use marijuana, 
      and poor grades. CONCLUSIONS: The female LSD user presents a distinct profile that 
      might aid clinicians in identifying potential LSD use in this population as well as 
      alerting clinicians to the relationship between LSD use and high-risk sexual 
      behaviors.

TI  - Long-term voluntary consumption of MDMA and THC in rats is modified by individual 
      and situational factors.
PG  - 131-44
AB  - Factors influencing long-term voluntary intake of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine 
      (MDMA; ecstasy) and Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; cannabis) were studied in a 
      rat model. Sixty-four male Wistar rats were given free choice for 49 weeks between 
      (1) water and MDMA solution, (2) water and THC solution or (3) water, MDMA solution 
      and THC solution. After the first experiences with the drugs, animals of both 
      monodrug and polydrug group developed an individually stable pattern of MDMA 
      consumption, whereas the individual predictability of THC consumption remained poor. 
      While THC consumption was maintained for the whole experimental period, MDMA 
      consumption decreased with time and was nearly ceased after 3-7 months. Intake of 
      both drugs was adapted to social changes, with THC consumption being more sensitive 
      to social changes than MDMA consumption. In the re-test after 4 months of 
      abstinence, all animals ceased drug consumption when the drug solutions were 
      adulterated with bitter tasting quinine. The results show that the rats had 
      maintained a flexible mode of drug consumption and had not become addicted. Response 
      to novelty of the rats in test trials before the start of drug supply correlated 
      with later MDMA intake. In conclusion, although very low amounts of MDMA and/or THC 
      were consumed, the findings that drug-experienced animals responded differentially 
      to a stressor and that housing conditions influenced drug intake suggests that MDMA 
      and THC can induce psychopharmacological effects in our long-term voluntary 
      consumption paradigm.

TI  - Rate of progression from first use to dependence on cocaine or opioids: a 
      cross-substance examination of associated demographic, psychiatric, and childhood 
      risk factors.

LID - S0306-4603(13)00323-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.10.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of demographic factors, psychiatric disorders, and childhood 
      risk factors have been associated with cocaine dependence (CD) and opioid dependence 
      (OD), but little is known about their relevance to the rate at which dependence 
      develops. Identification of the subpopulations at elevated risk for rapid 
      development of dependence and the risk factors that accelerate the course of 
      dependence is an important public health goal. METHODS: Data were derived from 
      cocaine dependent (n=6333) and opioid dependent (n=3513) participants in a 
      multi-site study of substance dependence. Mean age was approximately 40 and 40% of 
      participants were women; 51.9% of cocaine dependent participants and 29.5% of opioid 
      dependent participants self-identified as Black/African-American. The time from 
      first use to dependence was calculated for each substance and a range of 
      demographic, psychiatric, and childhood risk factors were entered into ordinal 
      logistic regression models to predict the (categorical) transition time to CD and 
      OD. RESULTS: In both the cocaine and opioid models, conduct disorder and childhood 
      physical abuse predicted rapid development of dependence and alcohol and nicotine 
      dependence diagnoses were associated with slower progression to CD or OD. 
      Blacks/African Americans were at greater risk than European Americans to progress 
      rapidly to OD. CONCLUSIONS: Only a subset of factors known to be associated with CD 
      and OD predicted the rate at which dependence developed. Nearly all were common to 
      cocaine and opioids, suggesting that sources of influence on the timing of 
      transitions to dependence are shared across the two substances.

TI  - Risk factors for syphilis: cocaine use and prostitution.
PG  - 853-7
AB  - In Philadelphia, a large increase in syphilis among minority group heterosexuals 
      began in 1986 and preceded similar increases elsewhere in the United States. To 
      determine reasons for this increase, we conducted a case-control study in the 
      metropolitan sexually transmitted diseases clinic during 1987 and 1988. Cocaine use 
      (odds ratio [OR] 3.1; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.5, 6.5 among men; OR 5.8; 
      95% CI = 1.5, 33 among women) and exchange of drugs for sex (OR 3.5; 95% CI = 1.4, 
      8.7 among men) were risk factors for syphilis. Although cocaine users reported more 
      sexual partners and more frequently reported sex with prostitutes, cocaine use 
      remained a risk factor after adjustment for these behaviors. These data suggest that 
      sexual behavior or another factor, such as availability or utilization of health 
      care, among cocaine users leads to increased risk of syphilis in this population. 
      Increases in cocaine use may be partly responsible for recent increases in syphilis 
      incidence in the United States.

TI  - Cocaine activates redox-regulated transcription factors and induces TNF-alpha 
      expression in human brain endothelial cells.
PG  - 125-33
AB  - Cocaine abuse is frequently associated with cerebrovascular pathology. Although the 
      cellular and molecular mechanisms of these alterations are not fully understood, 
      they may involve oxidative injury or dysfunction of brain microvascular endothelial 
      cells. To test this hypothesis, total glutathione levels, activation of nuclear 
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), as well as induction of 
      the TNF-alpha gene expression were determined in human brain microvascular 
      endothelial cells (HBMEC) exposed to cocaine. Exposure of HBMEC to cocaine resulted 
      in a dose-dependent depletion of total glutathione levels. In addition, cocaine 
      markedly activated redox-regulated transcription factors, NF-kappaB and AP-1. 
      Activation of these transcription factors was accompanied by induction of AP-1- or 
      NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, as measured by dual luciferase assay in HBMEC 
      transfected with the AP-1- or NF-kappaB-responsive reporter constructs. Furthermore, 
      HBMEC treatment with cocaine induced a dose-dependent expression of the tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene. These results indicate that exposure to 
      cocaine can trigger inflammatory pathways via activation of redox-sensitive 
      transcription factors and induction of expression of the inflammatory genes in 
      HBMEC. These events may contribute to the cerebrovascular insults observed in 
      cocaine-abused patients.

TI  - Hair analysis for cocaine: factors in laboratory contamination studies and their 
      relevance to proficiency sample preparation and hair testing practices.
PG  - 23-33
AB  - Hair samples were contaminated by rubbing with cocaine (COC) followed by sweat 
      application, multiple shampoo treatments and storage. The samples were then washed 
      with isopropanol for 15min, followed by sequential aqueous washes totaling 3.5h. The 
      amount of drug in the last wash was used to calculate a wash criterion to determine 
      whether samples were positive due to use or contamination. Analyses of cocaine and 
      metabolites were done by LC/MS/MS. These procedures were applied to samples produced 
      by a U.S. government-sponsored cooperative study, in which this laboratory 
      participated, and to samples in a parallel in-house study. All contaminated samples 
      in both studies were correctly identified as contaminated by cutoff, benzoylecgonine 
      (BE) presence, BE ratio, and/or the wash criterion. A method for determining hair 
      porosity was applied to samples in both studies, and porosity characteristics of 
      hair are discussed as they relate to experimental and real-world contamination of 
      hair, preparation of proficiency survey samples, and analysis of unknown hair 
      samples.

TI  - Neurotrophic factors in women with crack cocaine dependence during early abstinence: 
      the role of early life stress.
PG  - 206-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurotrophic factors have been investigated in the pathophysiology of 
      alcohol and drug dependence and have been related to early life stress driving 
      developmental programming of neuroendocrine systems. METHODS: We conducted a 
      follow-up study that aimed to assess the plasma levels of glial cell line-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth 
      factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT4/5) in crack users 
      during 3 weeks of early abstinence in comparison with healthy controls. We performed 
      a comprehensive clinical assessment in female inpatients with crack cocaine 
      dependence (separated into 2 groups: participants with (CSA+) and without (CSA-) a 
      history of childhood sexual abuse) and a group of nonuser control participants. 
      RESULTS: Our sample included 104 women with crack cocaine dependence and 22 
      controls; of the women who used crack cocaine, 22 had a history of childhood sexual 
      abuse and 82 did not. The GDNF plasma levels in the CSA+ group increased 
      dramatically during 3 weeks of detoxification. In contrast, those in the CSA- group 
      showed lower and stable levels of GDNF under the same conditions. Compared with the 
      control group, BDNF plasma levels remained elevated and NGF levels were reduced 
      during early abstinence. We found no differences in NT3 and NT4/5 between the 
      patients and controls. However, within-group analyses showed that the CSA+ group 
      exhibited higher levels of NT4/5 than the CSA- group at the end of detoxification. 
      LIMITATIONS: Some of the participants were using neuroleptics, mood stabilizers or 
      antidepressants; our sample included only women; memory bias could not be 
      controlled; and we did not investigate the possible confounding effects of other 
      forms of stress during childhood. CONCLUSION: This study supports the association 
      between early life stress and peripheral neurotrophic factor levels in crack cocaine 
      users. During early abstinence, plasmastic GDNF and NT4/5 were the only factors to 
      show changes associated with a history of childhood sexual abuse.

PG  - 977-85
LID - 10.1007/s11136-008-9376-8 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To analyse drug consumption patterns and demographic and medical factors 
      associated with health-related quality of life (HRQL) in a nonclinical sample of 
      regular cocaine consumers. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews with 687 young regular 
      cocaine users (aged 18-30 years) in three Spanish cities: Barcelona, Madrid and 
      Seville. HRQL was measured using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and degree of 
      dependence through the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS). Bivariate analyses were 
      conducted using nonparametric techniques, and a Tobit regression analysis was 
      carried out to determine which variables best explained HRQL. RESULTS: Most 
      participants showed a good HRQL, but differences in HRQL were found for 
      sociodemographic (gender), medical (days stayed in bed during the previous 12 
      months) and consumption-pattern related variables (length of drug use, intravenous 
      drug use, crack use, SDS). In multivariate analyses cocaine dependence measured by 
      SDS explained the greatest amount of HRQL variation. Although women declared worse 
      HRQL (13.6 versus 9.7, P < 0.01), in the final model with interactions no gender 
      differences were observed, except that HRQL for women worsened with the number of 
      days they had stayed in bed in the previous 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Even in early 
      phases of dependence, deterioration in HRQL is observed, mainly related to drug-use 
      history and patterns.

TI  - Behavioral factors predicting response to employment-based reinforcement of cocaine 
      abstinence in methadone patients.
PG  - 192-202
AB  - We sought to identify behavioral factors associated with response to an 
      employment-based intervention, in which participants had to provide drug-free urine 
      samples to gain access to paid employment. The present secondary analysis included 
      data from a randomized clinical trial. The trial evaluated whether employment-based 
      reinforcement could decrease cocaine use in community methadone patients. 
      Participants (N=56) in the trial worked in a model workplace for 4 hr every weekday 
      and earned about $10 per hr. After a 4-week baseline, participants were randomly 
      assigned to an Abstinence & Work (n = 28) or Work Only (n = 28) condition and could 
      work for an additional 26 weeks. Abstinence & Work participants had to provide 
      cocaine-negative urine samples to work and maintain maximum pay. Work Only 
      participants only had to work to earn pay. For Work Only participants, cocaine 
      abstinence during baseline and the intervention period were significantly (r(s) = 
      .72, p <.001) correlated. For Abstinence & Work participants, baseline opiate 
      abstinence was significantly correlated (r(s) = .59, p <.001) and workplace 
      attendance was marginally correlated (r(s) = .32, p = .098) with cocaine abstinence 
      during the intervention period. Furthermore, participants who provided over 60% 
      cocaine-negative urine samples during the intervention period (i.e., responders) had 
      significantly higher baseline rates of opiate abstinence (p <.0001) and workplace 
      attendance (p = .042) than non-responders. Employment-based reinforcement of cocaine 
      abstinence may be improved by increasing opiate abstinence and workplace attendance 
      prior to initiating the cocaine-abstinence intervention.

AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence rates of human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV, core antibody), hepatitis C 
      virus (HCV), and syphilis infections and analyze associated risk factors among 504 
      non-injecting cocaine users (NICU) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Participants were 
      interviewed in face-to-face sessions through a short structured questionnaire. Using 
      venipuncture, 10 mL of blood was collected. Seroprevalence rates were: HIV (6.3%), 
      HBV (9%), HCV (7.5%), and VDRL (4.2%). The risk of being infected with HIV, HBV, and 
      HCV was significantly associated with having had a sex partner who was either a drug 
      injector or who was known to be HIV positive. HIV and HCV infections were associated 
      with former imprisonment, and HCV was associated with having been tattooed. Because 
      of the rising number of NICU and the multiple infections detected, it is essential 
      to implement prevention strategies focused on this population.

TI  - MDMA ('ecstasy') use, and its association with high risk behaviors, mental health, 
      and other factors among gay/bisexual men in New York City.
PG  - 115-25
AB  - This study assesses patterns of use of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 
      'ecstasy'), and the characteristics of users, in a sample of 733 men who have sex 
      with men (MSM) in New York City. Among respondents, 13.7% reported using MDMA in the 
      past 6 months, with mean frequency of use of 6.24 times in that period. MDMA users 
      were found to be younger, less educated, to have had more male partners, more one 
      night stands with men, more visits to bars or clubs and sex clubs or bathhouses, to 
      have unprotected anal sex with a male, to be likely to have been the victim of 
      physical domestic violence, to have more gay/bisexual friends, to have disclosed 
      their sexual orientation to more friends, family members, and coworkers, and to have 
      higher levels of gay community participation and affiliation. Among MDMA users, 
      higher frequency of MDMA use was associated with being younger, having more visits 
      to bars or clubs, more gay/bisexual friends, and having an HIV negative test result 
      or never having been tested. MDMA users thus constitute a group at risk for sexually 
      transmitted diseases, including HIV, and other problems. The data suggest that MDMA 
      use is associated with being more 'out', which may be advantageous in helping gay 
      men deal with harmful psychological effects of stigma, but may place individuals in 
      settings that expose them to MDMA. These men have also presumably already been well 
      exposed to safer sex messages within the gay community, thus raising challenges for 
      interventions aimed at prevention, as well as opportunities (e.g. MSM and community 
      specific interventions) that need to be further explored.

TI  - Contextualising psychological distress among regular ecstasy users: the importance 
      of sociodemographic factors and patterns of drug use.
PG  - 243-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1465-3362.2009.00159.x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Considerable concern has been raised about associations 
      between ecstasy use and mental health. Studies of ecstasy users typically 
      investigate varying levels of lifetime use of ecstasy, and often fail to account for 
      other drug use and sociodemographic characteristics of participants, which may 
      explain mixed findings. The current study aimed to examine the relationship between 
      patterns of recent (last six months) ecstasy use and psychological distress among 
      current, regular ecstasy users, controlling for sociodemographic risk factors and 
      patterns of other drug use. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected from regular 
      ecstasy users (n = 752) recruited from each capital city in Australia as part of the 
      Ecstasy and related Drugs Reporting System (EDRS). Psychological distress was 
      assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Data were analysed 
      using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Seven per cent of the sample scored 
      in the 'high' distress category and 55% in the 'medium' distress category. Patterns 
      of ecstasy use were not independently associated with psychological distress. The 
      strongest predictors of distress were female sex, lower education, unemployment, 
      'binge' drug use including ecstasy (use for >48 h without sleep), frequent cannabis 
      use and daily tobacco use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Regular ecstasy users have 
      elevated levels of psychological distress compared with the general population; 
      however, ecstasy use per se was not independently related to such distress. Other 
      factors, including sociodemographic characteristics and other drug use patterns, 
      appear to be more important. These findings highlight the importance of targeting 
      patterns of polydrug use in order to reduce drug-related harm among regular ecstasy 
      users.

TI  - The factors of ketamine that affect sedation in children with oncology procedures: 
      parent satisfaction perspective.
PG  - S19-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pain and its complication during sedation with ketamine remain a 
      significant problem for children with hematologic malignancy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose 
      of the present study was to evaluate further the parental satisfaction for 
      procedural sedation and analgesia during pediatric hematology/oncology procedures 
      perfonned by pediatrician in the Department of Pediatrics, Phramongkutklao Hospital. 
      MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors prospectively evaluated our experience using 
      intravenous ketamine 1 mg/kg for oncology patients undergoing procedures at 
      Department ofPediatrics, Phramongkutklao Hospital. The procedure was assessed by way 
      ofaphysician-completed form and by evaluation of questionnaires given to parents to 
      estimate levels of pain by using a 0 to 10 mm visual analog scale (VAS) at 2 hours 
      after procedures and results in any adverse events with respect to age, gende, 
      procedures performed, ketamine dosage and recovery time. RESULTS: Total of46 
      children aged 6 months to 15 years with 46procedures were observed at pediatric unit 
      post-procedure. The indicationsfor procedural sedation and analgesia included lumbar 
      puncture and intrathecal chemotherapy (50%), bone marrow aspiration or biopsy 
      (21.7%), and both plrocedures (28.3%). The median VAS scale during oncology 
      procedures was 3, which were expressed by all the parents/guardians of the children 
      treated. Adverse effects were observed in all children including nausea (30.4%), 
      hypersalivation (26.1%), vomiting (21.7%), hallucinlation (4.2%). No child required 
      admission to hospital and there were no serious complications. CONCLUSION: 
      hntravenous ketamine 1 mg/kg is effective for invasive procedures in children with 
      malignancy. The use of intravenous ketamine may produce psychedelic effects in 
      children. These adverse effects may alter the child's comfort and parental 
      satisfaction especially in the young children.

TI  - Young adult Ecstasy users and multiple sexual partners: understanding the factors 
      underlying this HIV risk practice.
PG  - 237-44
AB  - The purposes of this study are to (1) examine the extent to which young adult 
      Ecstasy users recently reported having had multiple sex partners and (2) identify 
      the factors predictive of engaging in this behavior. Potential predictors included 
      demographic characteristics, background and experiences measures, childhood 
      maltreatment experiences, substance use variables, and measures assessing 
      psychological/psychosocial functioning. This research is based on a sample of 283 
      young adult recurrent users of the drug, Ecstasy. Study participants were recruited 
      in Atlanta, Georgia between August 2002 and August 2004 using a targeted sampling 
      and ethnographic mapping approach. Interviews took approximately two hours to 
      complete. Nearly one-third of the study participants had more than one sex partner 
      during the preceding month, and sexual protection rates tended to be low. 
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed seven predictors associated with 
      an increased likelihood of having multiple sex partners: (1) being nonwhite, (2) 
      knowing someone who was HIV-positive, (3) younger age of first sexual experience, 
      (4) using Ecstasy for its touch-enhancing qualities, (5) higher self-esteem, (6) 
      handling disagreements more dysfunctionally, and (7) not being involved in a 
      romantic relationship. The HIV prevention- and intervention-related implications of 
      these findings are discussed.

TI  - Crack cocaine use and other risk factors for tuberculin positivity in drug users.
PG  - 1183-90
AB  - Two-step tuberculin testing and standardized interviews of 793 current and former 
      drug users were performed to determine the risk factors for tuberculin positivity. 
      The prevalence of tuberculin positivity was 25%. Factors independently associated 
      with tuberculin positivity among participants seronegative for human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) included crack cocaine use (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 
      1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.5), employment as a home health aide 
      (adjusted OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.1), birth in Puerto Rico (adjusted OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 
      1.3-3.6), foreign birthplace (adjusted OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.6-13.6), African American 
      race (adjusted OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.0), reported tuberculosis exposure (adjusted 
      OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4), and older age (adjusted OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-6.7). 
      Additional risk factors among HIV-infected participants included alcoholism 
      (adjusted OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.0-5.8) and high CD4(+) lymphocyte count. Identification 
      of and administration of appropriate chemoprophylaxis to drug users with these risk 
      factors should be given high priority.

      of cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, sedatives, stimulants, and opiates in male 
      twins.
PG  - 687-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data on use and misuse of six classes of illicit substances by male twin 
      pairs were used to examine whether genetic and shared environmental risk factors for 
      substance use disorders are substance-specific or -nonspecific in their effect. 
      METHOD: Lifetime history of use and abuse/dependence of cannabis, cocaine, 
      hallucinogens, sedatives, stimulants, and opiates was assessed at personal interview 
      in both members of 1,196 male-male twin pairs ascertained by the Virginia Twin 
      Registry. Multivariate twin modeling of substance-nonspecific (common) and 
      substance-specific genetic, shared environmental, and unique environmental risk 
      factors was performed by using the program Mx. RESULTS: High levels of comorbidity 
      involving the different substance categories were observed for both use and 
      abuse/dependence. One common genetic factor was found to have a strong influence on 
      risk for illicit use and abuse/dependence for all six substance classes. A modest 
      influence of substance-specific genetic factors was seen for use but not for 
      abuse/dependence. Shared environmental factors were more important for use than for 
      abuse/dependence and were mediated entirely through a single common factor. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In an adult population-based sample of male twins, both the genetic and 
      the shared environmental effects on risk for the use and misuse of six classes of 
      illicit substances were largely or entirely nonspecific in their effect. 
      Environmental experiences unique to the person largely determine whether predisposed 
      individuals will use or misuse one class of psychoactive substances rather than 
      another.

TI  - Crack cocaine and the exchange of sex for money or drugs. Risk factors for gonorrhea 
      among black adolescents in San Francisco.
PG  - 7-13
AB  - In contrast to rates for the United States as a whole, the incidence rate of 
      gonorrhea increased 11% in San Francisco between 1986 and 1988, with substantial 
      increases observed among black adolescents. Reports by health department personnel 
      and police suggested that crack cocaine use, specifically the exchange of sex for 
      drugs, contributed to this increase. To test this hypothesis, the authors conducted 
      a case-control study from August 1988 to October 1988 that compared 68 prospectively 
      identified adolescent gonorrhea patients with 136 neighborhood control patients. 
      Thirty-two percent of the female gonorrhea patients had received money or drugs in 
      exchange for sex, while none of the control patients reported having done so (P = 
      0.0001). Most of the female patients (89%) who had received money or drugs in 
      exchange for sex had used crack. Crack use was less common among female patients who 
      denied receiving money or drugs in exchange for sex (11%) and among control patients 
      (6%). Crack use and providing money or drugs in exchange for sex were not risk 
      factors for gonorrhea among the male patients, but were reported frequently by both 
      gonorrhea patients and control patients. Not living with parents was a risk factor 
      for male patients (odds ratio 4.9, 95% confidence limit 1.4 to 19.5). For all 
      patients, a history of a sexually transmitted disease appeared to be an independent 
      risk factor for gonorrhea. The conclusion is made that crack-related exchange of sex 
      for money or drugs is a risk factor for gonorrhea among black adolescent girls in 
      San Francisco.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Factors associated with Ecstasy use in Turkish students.
PG  - 67-76
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to establish the factors associated with Ecstasy 
      use in secondary school students in Turkey. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      is a survey of a representative sample drawn from cities in different geographical 
      regions in Turkey in 1998 and 2001. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 
      18,556 and 11,911 10th-grade students in 1998 and 2001, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: 
      The questionnaire administered in the study was adapted from the questionnaires used 
      in 'Monitoring the Future' study in the United States and ESPAD (the European School 
      Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs). It included questions about demographic 
      characteristics, family characteristics, school life, social contacts and use of 
      substances. FINDINGS: While the percentage of those who used Ecstasy at least once 
      in their life-times was 2.65% in 1998, the figure reached 3.31% in 2001. Male 
      gender, older age, use of alcohol, cannabis, heroin and cocaine, non-medical use of 
      psychotherapeutic drugs and participation in a meeting concerning the adverse 
      effects of substance use were found to be significant variables predicting 'ever 
      use' of Ecstasy in both years by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ecstasy 
      use, while low in Turkey, appears to be on the increase and follows a pattern in 
      terms of correlates that is similar to other illicit drugs. Whatever the causes 
      behind the rise in Ecstasy use, creative, personalized and informative educational 
      programmes should be conducted in all educational institutions to curb Ecstasy use.

TI  - Cocaine Abuse, Traumatic Brain Injury, and Preexisting Brain Lesions as Risk Factors 
      for Bupropion-Associated Psychosis.
PG  - 459-463
LID - 10.1097/JCP.0000000000000729 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bupropion is generally considered safe and is widely used 
      both as a monotherapy and as an augmentation agent for the treatment of major 
      depression. Concerns have been raised about bupropion's propensity to precipitate 
      new psychosis and worsen existing psychotic symptoms, although the mechanism is 
      poorly understood. Three cases are reported in which bupropion use was associated 
      with psychosis. The aim of the study was to explore the risk factors and possible 
      mechanisms of psychosis in each case. CASE REPORTS: Case 1 describes the interaction 
      of cocaine abuse sensitization in a patient who developed psychosis with a lower 
      dosage of bupropion. Cases 2 and 3 discuss the role of traumatic brain injury and 
      structural brain lesions in increasing the risk of psychosis when using bupropion. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine abuse, traumatic brain injury, and preexisting brain lesions 
      appear to be risk factors for developing psychosis in persons taking bupropion. In 
      such cases, clinicians should carefully assess the risks and benefits and closely 
      monitor patients for symptoms of psychosis.

TI  - Factors associated with driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs among an 
      Australian sample of regular ecstasy users.
PG  - 24-31
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.08.012 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate factors associated with driving 
      under the influence (DUI) of alcohol and other drugs (ecstasy, cannabis and 
      methamphetamine) among a group of regular ecstasy users. Participants were those who 
      participated in the Australian Ecstasy and related Drug Reporting System (EDRS) in 
      2007 and had recently driven a motor vehicle (n=573). Participants were administered 
      a semi-structured face-to-face interview which included questions about ecstasy and 
      other drug use, associated health-related issues, and risk behaviours. Close to half 
      of those who were current consumers of ecstasy, cannabis, and methamphetamine had 
      recently driven under the influence of these drugs, while two-fifths of current 
      alcohol users reported recent drink driving. Frequency of use for each substance was 
      the most significant correlate of DUI of alcohol, cannabis, and methamphetamine, 
      suggesting that interventions targeting high frequency and problematic drug use may 
      be useful in reducing the occurrence of DUI for these substances. Low perception of 
      the likelihood of having an accident was the most significant correlate of DUI of 
      ecstasy and also related significantly to DUI of other substances. Perceptions of 
      low likelihood of being apprehended by police and demographic characteristics such 
      as younger age and male sex were also weakly associated with DUI. Together these 
      findings have important implications for targeted interventions aimed at reducing 
      the occurrence of DUI among regular drug users.

TI  - Predicting proximal factors in cocaine relapse and near miss episodes: clinical and 
      theoretical implications.
PG  - 67-78
AB  - This study examined the degree of correspondence between relapse vulnerability 
      factors assessed at intake to aftercare in 100 cocaine dependent patients and 
      proximal factors in their first cocaine relapse and near miss episodes during a 
      1-year follow-up. Proximal factors in relapse and near miss episodes were also 
      compared. Correspondence between experiences associated with prior use and 
      experiences in the week prior to relapse and near miss episodes was generally poor. 
      Psychiatric and family/social problem severity and coping factors at intake to 
      aftercare predicted experiences in the week prior to near misses, and to a lesser 
      degree, experiences in the week prior to relapse episodes. However, relapse 
      vulnerability factors were also associated with psychiatric and family/social 
      problem severity and mood during abstinent periods. Therefore, there was little 
      evidence of specificity in relationships between relapse vulnerability factors and 
      experiences prior to relapse. Proximal measures of coping, sensation seeking, 
      positive experiences, and unpleasant affect differentiated relapses from near misses 
      in a within-subjects analysis.

TI  - Immunohistochemical distribution of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript 
      peptide - like immunoreactive (CART-LI) nerve fibers and various degree of 
      co-localization with other neuronal factors in the circular muscle layer of human 
      descending colon.
PG  - 851-8
LID - 10.14670/HH-28.851 [doi]
AB  - Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CART) is a neuromediator 
      and/or neuromodulator in nerve structures within the gastrointestinal tract, but 
      knowledge about its distribution, functions and co-localisation with other neuronal 
      factors, especially in humans, is very scarce. During the present investigation the 
      distribution and immunohistochemical reaction (IR) of CART - like immunoreactive 
      (CART-LI) nerve fibers in the circular muscle layer of human descending colon were 
      studied. Fragments of human colon were processed for double labelling 
      immunofluorescence using a mixture of anti-CART antibodies with antibodies against 
      vesicular acetylocholine transporter (VAChT), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide 
      (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase - activating peptide (PACAP), substance P (SP), 
      galanin (GAL) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Thick CART-LI nerve fibers formed a 
      very dense meshwork within the colonic circular muscle layer in all patients 
      studied. The highest number of CART - positive nerves also contained VAChT and/or 
      VIP. A slightly lower level of co-localisation was observed in the case of CART and 
      PACAP or CART and NOS. Only single nerve fibers were concurrently immunoreactive to 
      CART and SP or CART and GAL. The present study reports for the first time a detailed 
      description of the IR of CART-LI nerve fibers in the circular muscle layer within 
      adult human descending colon.

TI  - Unconditioned and conditioned factors contribute to the 'reinstatement' of cocaine 
      place conditioning following extinction in C57BL/6 mice.
PG  - 151-60
AB  - Relapse to drug use following prolonged periods of abstinence results, in part, from 
      the ability of contextual cues paired previously with self-administered drug to 
      elicit drug craving and -seeking behavior. Given the popularity of the mouse for the 
      genetic analysis of drug-induced behaviors, a place conditioning model of 
      drug-seeking behavior was used to examine the ability of cocaine (COC) to reinstate 
      extinguished conditioned reward in mice. In a series of experiments, COC place 
      conditioning was produced in male C57BL/6 (B6) mice by four pairings of COC (15 or 
      25 mg/kg, IP) with the non-preferred compartment of a two-compartment place 
      conditioning apparatus. Following a post-conditioning test (Post-Test), place 
      conditioning was extinguished by repeated testing. The mice were then challenged 
      with one of five COC doses (0, 5, 10, 15 or 25 mg/kg, IP) and allowed free access to 
      both environments. Following extinction, COC injections reinstated place 
      conditioning to 100% or greater, relative to the Post-Test. In a control experiment, 
      mice received either COC or SAL paired with non-preferred compartment and were then 
      challenged with either COC (15 mg/kg, IP) or SAL on the Post-Test. COC-conditioned, 
      but not SAL-conditioned, mice exhibited place conditioning when tested in a COC-free 
      state. Interestingly, COC injection on the Post-Test elicited an increase in 
      approach behavior in both SAL- and COC-conditioned mice and this increase was 
      equivalent to that produced by COC conditioning alone. No direct relationships were 
      observed between the magnitude of place conditioning and either COC-induced or 
      -conditioned locomotor hyperactivity in the non-preferred compartment. Thus, at 
      least two independent processes appear to underlie the ability of a COC injection to 
      elicit approach behavior towards the non-preferred compartment of a biased place 
      conditioning apparatus in mice-reactivation of the conditioned incentive 
      motivational properties of COC-paired cues and elicitation of unconditioned 
      behavioral disinhibition. One or both of these processes sensitizes with the passage 
      of time, increasing the propensity of B6 mice to approach non-preferred environments 
      upon COC re-administration.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of ecstasy use among college students in Astara, Islamic 
      Republic of Iran.
PG  - 1192-200
AB  - We determined the prevalence and risk factors for 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine 
      (MDMA, "ecstasy") use among college students in Astara, a northern border city of 
      Iran. In a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 1226 students, the lifetime 
      prevalence of ecstasy use was 5.6%. The lifetime prevalence of use of other drugs, 
      mostly cannabis and opium, was 4.6%. A fifth of students (21.8%) were current 
      cigarette smokers and 24.8% had ever used alcohol. After logistic regression, the 
      factors influencing ever use of ecstasy were ever use of other drugs, ever use of 
      alcohol, current cigarette smoking and living alone or with friends. Targeted 
      prevention programmes should be conducted in all colleges.

LID - 10.1111/1440-1681.12557 [doi]
AB  - The present study investigates the role of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1 gene 
      in cocaine-induced renal damage in mice. Multiple doses of cocaine increased lipid 
      peroxidation, protein oxidation, and glutathione oxidation in the kidney of the 
      non-transgenic mice (non-TG mice). The enzymatic activities of GPx and glutathione 
      reductase were significantly decreased in non-TG mice, whereas superoxide dismutase 
      was increased in the early phase of cocaine exposure. Treatment with cocaine 
      resulted in significant decreases in expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl in the kidney of 
      non-TG mice, which resulted in significant increases in Bax and cleaved-caspase 3. 
      Consistently, cocaine-induced tubular epithelial vacuolization and focal tubular 
      necrosis were mainly observed in the proximal tubules in the kidneys of non-TG mice. 
      These renal pathologic changes were much less pronounced in GPx-1 TG than in non-TG 
      mice. These results suggest that the GPx-1 gene is a protective factor against 
      nephrotoxicity induced by cocaine via interactive modulations between antioxidant 
      and cell survival signaling processes.

TI  - Expression of mRNA of neurotrophic factors and their receptors are significantly 
      altered after subchronic ketamine treatment.
PG  - 256-63
AB  - The neurotrophic factors play an important role in the maintenance of neurone 
      viability and neuronal communication which are considered to be altered in 
      schizophrenia. Subchronic application of ketamine (Ket) was found to be a useful 
      model in schizophrenia research. To further validate this model the mRNA levels of 
      neurotrophic factors NGF, NT-3, and BDNF and their receptors TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, 
      respectively, were measured in different brain areas in Ket-pretreated rats 
      subchronically dosed with the atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone (Ris). With 
      the exception of NGF in the frontal cortex, Ket pretreatment did change NGF, NT-3, 
      and BDNF mRNA levels in the frontal cortex, the hippocampus, the striatum, the 
      thalamus/hypothalamus region, and in the cerebellum. These changes correspond with 
      changes at their tyrosine kinase receptors. Ris treatment normalised altered NT-3 
      levels in the hippocampus and balanced BDNF levels in the same structure. It was 
      concluded that the Ket model might reflect distinct alterations in neurotrophic 
      factor activity as found in schizophrenic patients and, moreover, that Ris treatment 
      rebalances disturbed neurotrophic factor activity.

LID - 10.1159/000306592 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/OBJECTIVES: Methylenedioxymethamphetamine affects the central serotonergic 
      system, and there is some evidence for an association between ecstasy use (drugs 
      sold as methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and depression. The aim of the present study 
      was to investigate the incidence of self-reported depression and associated 
      help-seeking among a sample of regular ecstasy users. A further aim was to examine 
      the correlates of depressive symptomatology in this population. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: 100 regular ecstasy consumers (at least monthly use) were interviewed as 
      part of the Ecstasy and Related Drug Reporting System in Tasmania, Australia. 
      Participants were also administered epidemiological measures of depression (Center 
      for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) and psychological distress (Kessler 
      Psychological Distress Scale). RESULTS: One quarter (23%) of participants 
      self-reported recent experience of depression, a rate notably greater than the 
      general population. However, only one third of these participants had attended a 
      health professional for this issue. A range of drug use factors (e.g. frequency and 
      quantity of ecstasy use, frequent cannabis or methamphetamine use, intravenous drug 
      use, polydrug use, binge drug use, harmful alcohol use, and elevated psychological 
      dependence scores for ecstasy and methamphetamine) were associated with high levels 
      of depressive symptomatology. CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with an 
      association between depressive symptomatology and ecstasy and other drug use. Harm 
      reduction strategies which target drug use factors such as those identified in this 
      study may also aid in the reduction of the experience of depression. Considering the 
      low levels of help-seeking among this population, improving awareness and access to 
      information and treatment for depression may also be important.

TI  - Dynamic interaction of genetic risk factors and cocaine abuse in the background of 
      Parkinsonism - a case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinsonism is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder, in 
      which genetic and environmental risk factors may both play a role. Among 
      environmental risk factors cocaine was earlier ambiguously linked to Parkinsonism. 
      Former single case reports described Parkinsonism in chronic cocaine users, but an 
      epidemiological study did not confirm an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Here 
      we report a patient, who developed Parkinsonism in young age after chronic cocaine 
      use, in whom a homozygous LRRK2 risk variant was also detected. CASE PRESENTATION: 
      The patient was investigated because of hand tremor, which started after a 1.5-year 
      period of cocaine abuse. Neurological examination suggested Parkinsonism, and 
      asymmetrical pathology was confirmed by the dopamine transporter imaging study. The 
      genetic investigations revealed a homozygous risk allele in the LRRK2 gene. After a 
      period of cocaine abstinence, the patient's symptoms spontaneously regressed, and 
      the dopamine transporter imaging also returned to near-normal. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      case report suggests that cocaine abuse indeed might be linked to secondary 
      Parkinsonism and serves as an example of a potential gene-environmental interaction 
      between the detected LRRK2 risk variant and cocaine abuse. The reversible nature of 
      the DaTscan pathology is a unique feature of this case, and needs further 
      evaluation, whether this is incidental or can be a feature of cocaine related 
      Parkinsonism.

TI  - Risk factors for experiencing psychosis during cocaine use: a preliminary report.
PG  - 178-82
AB  - Cocaine induced psychosis (CIP) is a common, but not universal side effect of 
      cocaine abuse. Factors underlying the development and severity of CIP remain poorly 
      understood. This study tests the hypothesis that earlier age of initiation of 
      regular use may increase the likelihood of developing CIP, or the severity of CIP 
      symptoms. METHODS: Cocaine use history and severity of CIP (if any) were assessed 
      with the Cocaine Experience Questionnaire in 51 abstinent (3 weeks-1 year) cocaine 
      dependent individuals. Subjects were divided into those with high and low CIP 
      severity, and into those with early age of initiation of regular cocaine use, and 
      later age of initiation. Various cutoffs between early and late age of initiation 
      were used, ranging from 15 to 22 years. RESULTS: From ages 17 through 20, 
      controlling for cumulative duration of use, severity scores were significantly 
      higher for the early initiation group than for the later initiation group (p values 
      ranged from 0.031 to 0.036). Cumulative duration of use, but not age of initiation, 
      significantly predicted initial development of CIP (p=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: The data 
      suggest that early age of initiation of regular cocaine use occurring during 
      vulnerable periods of brain development, may lead to increased severity of CIP.

TI  - Regulation of cocaine-induced activator protein 1 transcription factors by the 
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.
PG  - 253-64
AB  - Extracellular signal-regulated kinases and activator protein 1 transcription factor 
      have been functionally linked to addiction. It has also been shown that 
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation can regulate cocaine-induced 
      expression of c-Fos and FosB, two possible components of activator protein 1. A 
      direct link between extracellular signal-regulated kinases and activator protein 1 
      activation has, however, remained unexplored. In this study, we investigated the 
      role of extracellular signal-regulated kinases in the regulation of DNA-binding 
      activity and composition of activator protein 1 induced in the mouse caudate putamen 
      by cocaine treatment. We have found that pre-treatment with SL327, a selective 
      inhibitor the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, has no influence on 
      cocaine-induced DNA-binding activity of activator protein 1, when examined one hour 
      after an acute cocaine treatment. This phenomenon results from simultaneous decrease 
      of c-Fos protein level and increases in JunB and deltaFosB protein levels. SL327 
      pre-treatment, however, reduces the DNA-binding activity of the activator protein 1 
      complex induced six hours after an acute cocaine treatment as well as one hour after 
      the last of the chronic cocaine injections, a phenomenon that results from the 
      concomitant reduction of all cocaine-induced proteins (c-Fos, FosB, deltaFosB, 
      JunB). In conclusion, we have found that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
      inhibition may not only interfere with cocaine-induced gene expression and activator 
      protein 1 complex activation, but may also disturb the time-course of gene 
      expression and composition of activator protein 1 complex. Our results support the 
      notion that inhibitors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway could be 
      valuable tools to obliterate cocaine-induced molecular changes and the development 
      of addiction.

TI  - Cocaine abuse among opioid addicts: demographic and diagnostic factors in treatment.
PG  - 1-16
AB  - Cocaine is becoming a major drug of abuse among the general population and among 
      opiate addicts. Reports from the early 1970s found that most abusers were older 
      Black males with some antisocial characteristics. Cocaine abuse at that time was 
      reported by about 17% of opiate addicts seeking treatment and by 7 to 11% of 
      ex-addicts on methadone maintenance. However, that rate increased dramatically 
      during the 1970s, and in our 1980 study of 533 addicts we found that 74% of opiate 
      addicts applying for treatment used cocaine. It was the second most abused nonopioid 
      drug after marijuana, surpassing alcohol intoxication. Although the mean number of 
      days of abuse over the previous 30 days was substantially lower among the addicts on 
      our methadone maintenance program (mean = 1.4 days, n = 120) than among the addicts 
      applying for treatment (mean = 9 days, n = 204), the following associations with 
      cocaine abuse were consistent in both subsamples. Cocaine abuse was more frequent 
      among Blacks. It was associated with a variety of antisocial indices including 
      Research Diagnostic Criteria antisocial personality disorder, number of arrests, and 
      legal, family, employment, and drug abuse problems as assessed by the Addiction 
      Severity Index and the Social Adjustment Scale. Several differences emerged between 
      Black and White cocaine-abusing addicts, the most interesting being an increased 
      rate of anxiety disorders among White cocaine abusers. Based on these associations, 
      we offer several guidelines for treating cocaine abuse in opiate addicts.

TI  - Influence of neurotrophic factors on morphine- and cocaine-induced biochemical 
      changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system.
PG  - 969-79
AB  - Previous research has shown an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase in the ventral 
      tegmental area following chronic morphine and chronic cocaine treatments. Chronic 
      morphine treatment also increases levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein in this 
      brain region. In the present study, we investigated the effects of infusing 
      neurotropic factors (nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 
      neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4 or ciliary neurotrophic factor) via midline 
      intra-ventral tegmental area cannulae on these biochemical changes. Our studies 
      examined the effects of neurotrophic factor infusion alone, neurotrophic factor 
      infusion followed by morphine treatment, morphine treatment followed by neurotrophic 
      factor infusion, and concurrent neurotrophic factor infusion and cocaine treatment. 
      Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which by itself tended to decrease tyrosine 
      hydroxylase levels in the ventral tegmental area, prevented the characteristic 
      increase in tyrosine hydroxylase following morphine and cocaine exposure and 
      reversed the increase in rats pretreated with morphine. Neurotrophin-4 and 
      neurotrophin-3 exerted similar effects. In addition, neurotrophin-4 prevented the 
      morphine-induced increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein. In contrast, ciliary 
      neurotrophic factor infusions alone resulted in an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase 
      levels, with no additional increase induced by morphine or cocaine coadministration. 
      Nerve growth factor alone had no effect on tyrosine hydroxylase or glial fibrillary 
      acidic protein levels and did not affect morphine's ability to induce these 
      proteins. We also looked at the effects of intra-ventral tegmental area infusion of 
      neurotrophic factor on cAMP-dependent protein kinase and adenylyl cyclase activity 
      in the nucleus accumbens, both of which are increased by chronic morphine or cocaine 
      exposure. In general, regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and adenylyl 
      cyclase morphine by neurotrophic factors paralleled effects seen in the ventral 
      tegmental area. Intra-ventral tegmental area infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor (or neurotrophin-4) alone tended to decrease cAMP-dependent protein kinase 
      and adenylyl cyclase activity in the nucleus accumbens and prevented the 
      morphine-induced increases in these enzymes. These effects were not seen with 
      ciliary neurotrophic factor or nerve growth factor. These studies demonstrate novel 
      interactions within the ventral tegmental area, and its target the nucleus 
      accumbens, between neurotrophic factors and drugs of abuse, which have potentially 
      important implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of drug addiction.

      computer search of ICD-9 codes identified 100 patients admitted to two inner city 
      hospitals between 1986 and 1995 with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke who also 
      tested positive for cocaine in the urine. The case records of these patients were 
      reviewed retrospectively. The ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke groups were compared 
      with a control group of 109 cocaine users without a history of stroke. Multiple 
      logistic regression was performed to see if the classic stroke risk factors 
      independently increased the risk of cocaine-induced ischemic and/or hemorrhagic 
      stroke. RESULTS: A total of 66 stroke patients in the study group had ischemic 
      stroke, whereas 34 had hemorrhagic stroke. The stroke and control groups were 
      similar in racial and gender composition. The mean ages of patients with ischemic 
      and hemorrhagic stroke (both 41 years) were greater than the control group (34 
      years) (P<.01). Only chronic hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 5.2, P<.0001) and older 
      age (OR 1.08/year increase of age, P<.0006) were independent risk factors for 
      ischemic stroke. Female sex (OR 3.2, P<.015) and older age (OR 1.1/year increase of 
      age, P<.0002) were independent risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Chronic hypertension and older age may magnify the risk of cocaine-related ischemic 
      stroke, whereas female sex and older age may increase the risk of cocaine-related 
      hemorrhagic stroke.

AB  - The role of genotype as a determinant of biologically based inter-individual 
      differences in vulnerability to substance abuse has received little systematic 
      investigation except in the case of alcohol. This report describes the use of an 
      animal model, the inbred mouse, to identify and to characterize variants with 
      inherently altered susceptibilities to the rewarding and other behavioral actions of 
      cocaine. Among a battery of nine inbred strains chosen solely for their genetic 
      diversity, genetic polymorphisms commonly occurred which altered the potency and/or 
      efficacy of cocaine to induce conditioned place preference, oral 
      self-administration, motor activity activation, seizures and lethality. These 
      changes in cocaine sensitivity generally were of a behavior-specific and 
      pharmacodynamic nature. One strain, DBA/2J, found to be markedly hyporesponsive to 
      the rewarding action of cocaine, also was hyporesponsive to the rewarding effects of 
      amphetamine, etonitazene, phencyclidine, caffeine and procaine. We speculate that 
      this strain has an inherent generalized appetitive defect. The frequent occurrence 
      and large magnitude of inherent phenotypic changes in cocaine responsiveness which 
      we have identified among inbred mouse strains now permits an analytical genetic 
      study of processes underlying cocaine-mediated reinforcement.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic determinants of cocaine's differential effects on locomotor and 
      operant behavior.
PG  - 85-92
AB  - Dose-response, effect-time and concentration-effect relations of intravenous cocaine 
      (1-4 mg/kg) were investigated on contingency-controlled [fixed-ratio (FR) 70 
      performance] and unconditioned (locomotor activity) behaviors. Cocaine dose-response 
      curves exhibited decreasing rates of response under the FR 70 schedule but 
      increasing locomotor activity in a dose-related fashion. Effect-time profiles 
      confirmed that these changes were time-dependent and provided additional clarity by 
      mirroring the biexponential decay of cocaine concentrations with time. The duration 
      of action of cocaine was comparatively shorter on locomotor activity than on FR 
      performance. We integrated effect-time profiles of the two behaviors with 
      concentration-time profiles simulated from our previously published pharmacokinetic 
      parameters to derive cocaine's pharmacodynamic parameters. Classical inhibitory Emax 
      and sigmoidal Emax models were used to describe cocaine's effects on FR performance 
      and locomotor activity, respectively. Simultaneous pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
      modeling reveals evidence of acute tolerance to cocaine in locomotor activity, as 
      indicated by decreasing potency with dose, but not in contingency-controlled 
      behavior.

TI  - Cognitive determinants of MDMA use among college students in Southern Taiwan.
PG  - 2199-211
AB  - This study was aimed to examine the Attitudes-Social influence-Efficacy Model for 
      the use of MDMA among college students in Taiwan. A representative sample of 3743 
      college students participated in this study. Each participant completed a 
      comprehensive survey and 3090 valid data were collected. Correlation analyses 
      displayed that either positive outcome expectancy or social influence was positively 
      related to intention while refusal self-efficacy was negatively associated with 
      intention. Using the Structural Equation Model, the results showed that the model 
      fitted the data well. Intention for using MDMA affected MDMA use. Refusing 
      self-efficacy significantly predicted intention and MDMA use indirectly via 
      intention. Social influence had a direct impact on intention or MDMA use as well as 
      an indirect effect on MDMA use via intention. However, positive outcome expectancy 
      did not have an effect on both intention and the use of MDMA. Our results suggested 
      that preventive programs in colleges for MDMA use should focus on developing 
      strategies in decreasing the social influence and enhancing the refusal 
      self-efficacy.

TI  - Reinforcing effects of oral cocaine: contextual determinants.
PG  - 143-52
AB  - RATIONALE: Although the behavioral, subjective, and physiological effects of oral 
      cocaine have been investigated, its reinforcing effects have not been demonstrated. 
      OBJECTIVE: The primary aims of this study were to examine the reinforcing effects of 
      oral cocaine and determine whether such effects can be influenced by manipulating 
      behavioral requirements following drug ingestion. METHODS: Nine adult volunteers 
      with histories of cocaine abuse were trained to discriminate between orally 
      administered cocaine (100 mg/70 kg) and placebo capsules under double-blind 
      conditions. Following acquisition of cocaine vs placebo discrimination (80% 
      correct), the reinforcing effects of cocaine were determined using two different 
      choice conditions (dependent and independent). Volunteers were first exposed to 
      cocaine and placebo once each with a relaxation activity (sitting in a cushioned 
      chair) and a vigilance activity (performing a computer task). Following exposure to 
      each drug with each activity, volunteers began the dependent choice condition. Every 
      2 days volunteers chose which drug (cocaine or placebo) they ingested with the 
      vigilance and relaxation activities. Volunteers could not choose the same drug with 
      both activities. This procedure occurred 5 times over a 10-day period. The 
      independent choice condition took place over 2 days. On one day, volunteers chose 
      which drug (cocaine or placebo) they ingested with the relaxation activity and, on 
      the other day (in counterbalanced order), which drug they ingested with the 
      vigilance activity. Volunteers were allowed to select the same drug with both 
      activities. RESULTS: All volunteers successfully acquired the cocaine vs placebo 
      discrimination. In the dependent choice condition, all volunteers significantly 
      chose cocaine over placebo with the vigilance activity and chose placebo over 
      cocaine with the relaxation activity. In the independent choice condition, 
      volunteers significantly chose cocaine over placebo with the vigilance activity 
      (i.e., cocaine functioned as a positive reinforcer in the vigilance context). 
      Interestingly, the independent choice condition also showed that volunteers chose 
      placebo over cocaine with the relaxation activity (i.e., cocaine functioned as a 
      negative reinforcer because it was avoided relative to placebo). CONCLUSION: The 
      study shows that the behavioral requirements following drug ingestion can be a 
      determinant of whether or not oral cocaine functions as a reinforcer in volunteers 
      with histories of cocaine abuse.

TI  - Cocaine- and alcohol-mediated expression of inducible transcription factors is 
      blocked by pentobarbital anesthesia.
PG  - 251-61
AB  - Identifying the neurocircuitry involved in behavioral responses to drugs of abuse is 
      an important step towards understanding the mechanisms of drug addiction. The 
      present study sought to distinguish brain regions involved in pharmacological 
      effects of cocaine and ethanol from secondary effects by administering these drugs 
      in the presence or absence of pentobarbital anesthesia. Changes in neuronal activity 
      were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of expression of an inducible 
      transcription factor (ITF), c-Fos, in the brain of rats habituated to repeated 
      pentobarbital anesthesia or saline administration. Cocaine administration (15 mg/kg, 
      i.v.) in non-anesthetized animals produced a strong induction of c-Fos in the 
      striatum and large number of other brain areas. Ethanol administration (2 g/kg, 
      i.p.) induced c-Fos in a smaller number of characteristic brain areas, including the 
      central nucleus of amygdala and paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus. However, 
      neither of these drugs was able to induce c-Fos in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats 
      (50 mg/kg, i.v.). The suppressive effects of pentobarbital were not specific to 
      c-Fos, such that pentobarbital also suppressed expression of ITFs FosB and Egr1 in 
      the striatum of cocaine-treated rats. On the other hand, pentobarbital by itself 
      strongly induced c-Fos expression in the lateral habenula of saline-, cocaine-, and 
      ethanol-injected rats. It is not clear whether the suppressive effects of anesthesia 
      on ITF expression in other areas are mediated by activation of lateral habenula, or 
      are independent of this event. Our data suggest that in the absence of conscious 
      awareness of drug-associated cues, cocaine and alcohol activate only a fraction of 
      the neural elements engaged in the unanesthetized state.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine parameters related to hyperdensity (>40 HU) of intra-corporeal 
      cocaine packets on low-dose CT (LDCT); hyperdensity increases detectability on 
      abdominal radiographs. METHODS: LDCT showing drug packets (n = 46) were analyzed for 
      mean radiological density and packets volume. Following expulsion, packets weight 
      and cocaine concentration were measured. Hypercompaction was defined as 
      >0.9 g/cm(3). RESULTS: Packets were hyperdense in 33 cases (72%). Mean compaction 
      was 1.0 g/cm(3), mean density 118.5 HU and mean cocaine concentration 44.2%. On 
      multivariate analysis, only high compaction remained significantly related to 
      hyperdensity (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Compaction >0.9 g/cm(3) is the only parameter 
      significantly associated with hyperdense packets.

TI  - A qualitative analysis of GHB use among gay men: Reasons for use despite potential 
      adverse outcomes.
PG  - 23-28
AB  - This paper examines the use of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) among a sample of gay men 
      in New York City, who identify GHB as their most frequently used club drug. The 
      sample was drawn from a larger longitudinal investigation of club drug using men. 
      Thematic analysis yielded findings regarding perceived stigma for GHB use, tolerance 
      of potential adverse side effects, and reasons for why some prefer this substance to 
      other club drugs. Specifically, our findings suggest that GHB is viewed unfavorably 
      in many social circles, that side effects are tolerated by frequent GHB users, and 
      that the drug is chosen over other substances because the short duration of action, 
      energy boost, sleep assistance, increase in libido, and limited after-effects. 
      Examining the reasons why men use this substance will lead to the development of GHB 
      specific prevention strategies, which accurately address the consequences of use as 
      well as the motivations that individuals possess for using the substance.

TI  - Factors associated with adverse reactions to cocaine among a sample of long-term, 
      high-dose users in São Paulo, Brazil.
PG  - 365-74
AB  - This cross-sectional survey investigates the frequency of adverse cocaine reactions 
      and associated factors among regular cocaine misusers. A sample of 332 cocaine 
      misusers from a range of treatment and nontreatment settings in São Paulo, Brazil, 
      were interviewed using a questionnaire that includes the Severity of Dependence 
      Scale (SDS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), the CAGE, and an eight-item 
      questionnaire investigating the frequency of specific adverse cocaine reactions. The 
      most commonly described reactions were hot flushes (84%), uncontrollable shaking 
      (76%), and feeling ill (75%). The most severe symptoms and least common were 
      convulsions or fits (18%) and passing out (21%). Frequency of adverse reactions to 
      cocaine was positively associated with out-of-treatment status, severity of cocaine 
      dependence, ever having injected cocaine, using tranquilisers with cocaine, and GHQ 
      score. Adverse reactions to cocaine are common among regular cocaine users. Some of 
      the adverse effects, especially those on the heart and central nervous system, are 
      potentially fatal. Preventive strategies should be developed to reduce the risk of 
      adverse cocaine reactions. The findings are discussed in relation to the type of 
      interventions that might be developed and lines of future research.

TI  - Factors associated with depressive symptoms in African American crack cocaine 
      smokers.
PG  - 161-174
AB  - Few studies have examined factors associated with depressive symptoms in crack 
      cocaine smokers, although cocaine use has been linked to depression. The purpose of 
      this study was to identify correlates of depressive symptoms in a sample of 799 
      HIV-positive and HIV-seronegative African-American crack cocaine smokers. Multiple 
      regression modelling revealed that anxiety was strongly and positively associated 
      with depressive symptoms. In addition, being female and more frequent crack smoking 
      were also found to be associated. Higher self-esteem and decision-making confidence 
      were found to be associated with less often experiencing depressive symptoms. The 
      model accounted for 64% of the variance in the data. It was noteworthy that HIV 
      infection, as such, was not associated with depressive symptoms. The study has 
      important implication for mental health and health promotion interventions targeting 
      crack cocaine smokers.

TI  - Conditioning, habituation and behavioral reorganization factors in chronic cocaine 
      effects.
PG  - 149-57
AB  - Rats were administered cocaine (50.0 mg/kg i.p.) daily for 7 days in a Pavlovian 
      paradigm either immediately prior (paired group) or 30 min following (unpaired 
      group) a 20-min placement in an open field test environment. After 7 days of drug 
      withdrawal, the animals were retested 3 days apart, once with saline and once with 
      cocaine (50 mg/kg). Measurement of locomotion as distance traversed (m) revealed a 
      higher level of locomotion in the paired group on all test trials. Analysis of the 
      paired vs. unpaired differences indicated an antihabituation effect of cocaine 
      rather than a hyperlocomotion or a conditioned locomotor effect. Rotation pattern 
      analysis for each animal showed a new frequency distribution of rotations across 
      four categories of diameter size in the paired but not in the unpaired group by Day 
      5. This new pattern was characterized by a shift in skewness toward large greater 
      than or equal to 55 cm diameter rotations. These qualitative changes in rotation 
      pattern point to a context specific behavioral reorganization process in response to 
      repeated cocaine drug treatment.

TI  - Factors accounting for cocaine use two years following initiation of continuing 
      care.
PG  - 213-25
AB  - AIMS: To examine the relationship between various interpersonal, intrapersonal and 
      situational factors assessed at 6, 12 and 18 months after entrance to continuing 
      care, and cocaine use in subsequent periods. DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial 
      with a 2-year follow-up. SETTING: An outpatient US Veterans Administration substance 
      abuse treatment program. PARTICIPANTS: Cocaine-dependent male veterans (N = 132) 
      entering continuing care. INTERVENTIONS: 12-Step focused group treatment vs. 
      individualized relapse prevention continuing care. MEASUREMENTS: Motivation, coping 
      and mood, social support, co-morbid problem severity, treatment attendance, 
      self-help participation and cocaine use variables were assessed at each follow-up. 
      FINDINGS: During the 2-year follow-up, patients used cocaine on fewer than 8% of the 
      days in each of the four 6-month periods, which represented a highly significant 
      decrease in relation to cocaine use prior to treatment. In univariate analyses, 
      abstinence commitment, self-efficacy, positive mood, support from family, 
      employment, attendance in continuing care and self-help participation at two or more 
      of the follow-ups predicted less cocaine use in subsequent 6-months periods. 
      Readiness to change and medical, psychiatric, legal and family/social problem 
      severities either did not predict, or were inconsistently related to, subsequent 
      cocaine use. In multivariate analyses, degree of self-help participation emerged as 
      the strongest and most consistent predictor of cocaine use. However, when current 
      cocaine use at each follow-up was controlled, none of the predictors was significant 
      at more than one follow-up point. There was little evidence of interactions between 
      treatment condition and the predictor variables. CONCLUSIONS: Continued self-help 
      participation and the early achievement of cocaine abstinence appear to be important 
      factors in the maintenance of good cocaine use outcomes over extended periods. The 
      results also highlight the importance of controlling for various post-treatment 
      factors when evaluating the relationship between any one factor and subsequent 
      outcome, as many of the factors that were significant predictors in the univariate 
      analyses were no longer significant when other factors were controlled.

TI  - Transcription factors specifying dopamine phenotype are decreased in cocaine users.
PG  - 401-4
AB  - During development, survival of midbrain dopamine neurons and specification of their 
      phenotype are dependent upon the intracellular expression of a number of 
      transcription factors, including Engrailed 1, Pitx3, and Nurr1. The role of these 
      transcription factors in the maintenance of the dopaminergic phenotype is less 
      clear. In the present study, we show that each of these transcription factors is 
      robustly expressed in adult dopamine neurons in human midbrain, and that cocaine 
      abuse is associated with a significant decrease in the abundance of Nurr1 and Pitx3 
      in these cells. These data suggest that cocaine abuse leads to a partial loss of 
      dopaminergic phenotype.

TI  - Design of high-activity mutants of human butyrylcholinesterase against (-)-cocaine: 
      structural and energetic factors affecting the catalytic efficiency.
PG  - 9113-9
LID - 10.1021/bi1011628 [doi]
AB  - The present study was aimed to explore the correlation between the protein structure 
      and catalytic efficiency of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) mutants against (-)-cocaine 
      by modeling the rate-determining transition state (TS1), i.e., the transition state 
      for the first step of chemical reaction process, of (-)-cocaine hydrolysis catalyzed 
      by various mutants of human BChE in comparison with the wild type. Molecular 
      modeling of the TS1 structures revealed that mutations on certain nonactive site 
      residues can indirectly affect the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme against 
      (-)-cocaine through enhancing or weakening the overall hydrogen bonding between the 
      carbonyl oxygen of (-)-cocaine benzoyl ester and the oxyanion hole of the enzyme. 
      Computational insights and predictions were supported by the catalytic activity data 
      obtained from wet experimental tests on the mutants of human BChE, including five 
      new mutants reported for the first time. The BChE mutants with at least ∼1000-fold 
      improved catalytic efficiency against (-)-cocaine compared to the wild-type BChE are 
      all associated with the TS1 structures having stronger overall hydrogen bonding 
      between the carbonyl oxygen of (-)-cocaine benzoyl ester and the oxyanion hole of 
      the enzyme. The combined computational and experimental data demonstrate a 
      reasonable correlation relationship between the hydrogen-bonding distances in the 
      TS1 structure and the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme against (-)-cocaine.

TI  - Factors that determine a propensity for cocaine-seeking behavior during abstinence 
      in rats.
PG  - 626-41
AB  - Individual differences in locomotor responses to novelty and psychostimulants, and 
      sensitization following repeated drug exposure, predict increased sensitivity to the 
      reinforcing effects of psychostimulants and are thought to underlie vulnerability to 
      drug addiction. This study tested whether these factors determine another core 
      feature of drug addiction, the propensity for drug-seeking behavior during 
      abstinence in rats with prior cocaine-self-administration experience. Low and high 
      response groups for each of these factors were determined in outbred rats by the 
      median locomotor response to novelty and amphetamine prior to cocaine 
      self-administration (pre-test), and to amphetamine during abstinence (post-test). 
      Cocaine-seeking behavior during abstinence was measured by the level of drug-paired 
      lever responding during extinction, and also during reinstatement induced by 
      cocaine-associated cues, an amphetamine priming injection, and footshock stress. 
      Animals with low and high locomotor responses to novelty and the amphetamine 
      pre-test showed similar levels of cocaine-seeking behavior during extinction and 
      reinstatement testing. Locomotor responses to amphetamine following cocaine 
      self-administration (post-test) also failed to determine amphetamine's ability to 
      reinstate cocaine-seeking behavior. Conversely, high levels of amphetamine-induced 
      reinstatement were associated specifically with escalating cocaine intake during 
      prior self-administration. These animals also developed locomotor sensitization to 
      amphetamine following cocaine self-administration (post-test vs. pre-test), but the 
      capacity to develop locomotor sensitization was not sufficient to determine a 
      propensity for cocaine-seeking behavior. The findings suggest that the relationship 
      between locomotor responses to novelty, amphetamine and behavioral sensitization 
      a,nd the propensity for cocaine-seeking behavior during abstinence is complex, while 
      the level of drug intake during prior self-administration is a primary determinant 
      of this behavior.

TI  - Custody of cocaine-exposed newborns: determinants of discharge decisions.
PG  - 1726-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Maternal cocaine use is a leading grounds for newborn foster placement. 
      This study was initiated to investigate the factors that predict custody status of 
      infants born to substance-abusing women. METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was 
      used to study the correlates of discharge custody decisions for 99 consecutive 
      infants testing positive for cocaine in a public hospital. RESULTS: The population 
      was 49% Black, 40% Hispanic, and 11% other or unknown. Custody at discharge was to 
      mothers (38%), other family members (25%), or agency foster care (36%). Placement 
      outside the family was greater when mothers had prior child welfare records, in 
      Blacks vs others, with no prenatal care, and when mothers were younger at their 
      first delivery or older at the index birth. Denial of custody to the mother was 
      higher with prior child welfare involvement, in Blacks, and when the mother did not 
      live in her own home. Both models also controlled for parity, child sex, and 
      birthweight. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier involvement with child welfare authorities, race, 
      and other factors predict continued separation of mothers and children at newborn 
      discharge, suggesting the need to reexamine current policies and practices.

TI  - Psychosocial risk factors associated with cocaine use during pregnancy: a 
      case-control study.
PG  - 142-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether psychosocial risk factors predict cocaine use 
      during pregnancy. METHODS: We sampled 229 pregnant women from an urban prenatal 
      clinic. Drug use ascertainment was based on self-report and urine toxicology, with 
      102 subjects classified as drug users and 127 as nonusers. A questionnaire measuring 
      seven psychosocial risk factors was administered. The predictive relation between 
      these characteristics and drug use was ascertained through multivariate analyses, 
      controlling for potential sociodemographic confounders. RESULTS: Six of the seven 
      psychosocial risk factors were significant predictors for this sociodemographic 
      group. Women who used cocaine during pregnancy were more likely to have a family 
      history of alcohol or drug problems, to have been introduced to drugs by a male 
      partner, to be depressed, to have less social support, to have current partners who 
      were substance users, and to have less-stable living situations. Both groups of 
      subjects had high rates of childhood sexual abuse, but this alone was not predictive 
      of drug use. In addition, cigarette smoking was a strong predictor of illicit drug 
      use. CONCLUSION: Identification of multiple psychosocial risk factors has 
      implications for the identification and treatment of substance-using pregnant women. 
      Because cocaine users and nonusers did not differ in gestational age at entry into 
      prenatal care, opportunities exist for intervention during pregnancy. Based on the 
      study findings, evaluation of the following aspects of a patient's lifestyle can aid 
      in the detection of cocaine use during pregnancy: smoking status, family history of 
      alcohol or drug problems, and current drug use by a male partner.

      treated cocaine abusers.
PG  - 138-44
LID - 10.1080/00952990902825397 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying treatments that produce specific benefits in nondrug 
      psychosocial functioning areas such as employment functioning has been illusive. 
      Examination of dimensions of clinical status that moderate such effects may be 
      useful in planning more effective interventions. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this 
      study is to determine if life stress and four dimensions of personality and 
      psychopathology previously found to predict early post-treatment relapse in diverse 
      groups of substance abusers, predict less recovery in employment functioning among 
      240 cocaine dependent males after completion of residential treatment. METHODS: 
      Latent growth curve analysis was used to determine if antisocial, avoidant, 
      dependent, paranoid-delusional personality dimensions, and life event stress predict 
      employment problem severity evident at drug treatment discharge and change in 
      employment problems over three 3-month follow-up intervals. RESULTS: Individuals 
      with higher employment severity at intake and those who spent less time in treatment 
      tended to have greater employment problems at the predischarge. Two covariates were 
      significant predictors of the linear growth component, and the set of covariates 
      explained approximately 18% of the variation in the linear growth rates. Individuals 
      with higher paranoid/delusional scores and lower educational attainment experienced 
      less improvement in their employment status over follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Current 
      findings appear consistent with those of McLellan and colleagues who found that 
      greater psychiatric severity predicts poor response to treatment across multiple 
      psychosocial outcomes including employment status. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: More 
      intensive and long-term psychiatric treatment and vocational-educational 
      rehabilitative services may be required for improvement in employment functioning 
      among those with relatively severe psychopathology.

TI  - Sigma-1 receptor mediates cocaine-induced transcriptional regulation by recruiting 
      chromatin-remodeling factors at the nuclear envelope.
PG  - E6562-70
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1518894112 [doi]
AB  - The sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) chaperone at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays 
      important roles in cellular regulation. Here we found a new function of Sig-1R, in 
      that it translocates from the ER to the nuclear envelope (NE) to recruit 
      chromatin-remodeling molecules and regulate the gene transcription thereof. Sig-1Rs 
      mainly reside at the ER-mitochondrion interface. However, on stimulation by agonists 
      such as cocaine, Sig-1Rs translocate from ER to the NE, where Sig-1Rs bind NE 
      protein emerin and recruit chromatin-remodeling molecules, including lamin A/C, 
      barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), and histone deacetylase (HDAC), to form a 
      complex with the gene repressor specific protein 3 (Sp3). Knockdown of Sig-1Rs 
      attenuates the complex formation. Cocaine was found to suppress the gene expression 
      of monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) in the brain of wild-type but not Sig-1R knockout 
      mouse. A single dose of cocaine (20 mg/kg) in rats suppresses the level of MAOB at 
      nuclear accumbens without affecting the level of dopamine transporter. Daily 
      injections of cocaine in rats caused behavioral sensitization. Withdrawal from 
      cocaine in cocaine-sensitized rats induced an apparent time-dependent rebound of the 
      MAOB protein level to about 200% over control on day 14 after withdrawal. Treatment 
      of cocaine-withdrawn rats with the MAOB inhibitor deprenyl completely alleviated the 
      behavioral sensitization to cocaine. Our results demonstrate a role of Sig-1R in 
      transcriptional regulation and suggest cocaine may work through this newly 
      discovered genomic action to achieve its addictive action. Results also suggest the 
      MAOB inhibitor deprenyl as a therapeutic agent to block certain actions of cocaine 
      during withdrawal.

TI  - Risk factors for suicidal ideation in a population of community-recruited female 
      cocaine users.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Suicide, as the 11th leading cause of death in America, is a 
      significant public health concern. Previous studies have shown that drug users are a 
      population at especially high risk for suicidal ideation (SI). Although most people 
      who think about killing themselves do not ultimately commit suicide, identifying 
      those at risk for such thoughts is important. METHODS: In this analysis, data from a 
      sample of 462 cocaine-using women (87% African American) recruited using street 
      outreach methods for a National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded study were examined 
      to identify risk factors for lifetime SI. Sociodemographic factors, adverse 
      childhood experiences, sexual behaviors, psychiatric comorbidities, and drug abuse 
      and dependence were examined as potential risk factors using both bivariate and 
      logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Fifty percent of the sample met at least one 
      criterion for lifetime SI, and 32% of the sample reported a lifetime suicide 
      attempt. In the final logistic regression model, childhood physical abuse, childhood 
      sexual abuse, rape after the age of 15 years, posttraumatic stress disorder, and 
      number of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, 
      depression criteria met emerged as significant independent predictors of lifetime 
      SI. CONCLUSION: These findings identify important risk factors for SI among female 
      substance abusers in community settings.

TI  - Temporal factors affecting cocaine-opioid interactions: a cocaine drug 
      discrimination study in rats.
PG  - 427-34
AB  - RATIONALE: Increasing concomitant abuse of cocaine and morphine-like opioids has 
      prompted a number of studies aimed at understanding how these drugs interact. 
      OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to determine if variations in opioid 
      pretreatment time would affect how mu opioid agonists interact with cocaine. 
      METHODS: Rats were trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg cocaine from saline. One group 
      of subjects (n=6) received morphine (5.6 mg/kg) 0.5 h, 1 h or 4 h prior to 
      cumulative doses of cocaine (0.1-17.8 mg/kg). These pretreatment times were selected 
      to overlap with states of acute opioid tolerance (approximately 1 h) or acute opioid 
      dependence (approximately 4 h) as demonstrated by previous studies. A second group 
      (n=6) was administered naloxone (0.3 mg/kg) 5 min prior to cumulative cocaine doses, 
      with or without a 4-h morphine (5.6 mg/kg) or methadone (3.0 mg/kg) pretreatment. In 
      a third procedure, the same subjects used in the second experiment were also tested 
      for time-dependent changes in the analgesic effect of morphine using a hot-plate 
      assay. RESULTS: Morphine pretreatment 1 h prior to assessment of the cocaine 
      dose-response function significantly enhanced the discriminative stimulus effects of 
      cocaine. However, neither 0.5-h or 4-h morphine pretreatment had any effect. In 
      contrast, when naloxone was administered 4 h following either morphine or methadone 
      and 5 min prior to assessment of the cocaine dose-response curve, the discriminative 
      stimulus effects of cocaine were significantly attenuated. In assessing 
      morphine-induced analgesia, paw-lick latency was significantly longer at 1 h and 
      shorter at 4 h following morphine administration. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      illustrate the importance of temporal parameters for interactions between cocaine 
      and mu opioid agonists.

TI  - Factors affecting serum protein binding of cocaine in humans.
PG  - 605-10
AB  - The free (unbound) drug in serum is an important determinant of pharmacologic 
      response. The present study was performed to more completely identify and evaluate 
      factors affecting cocaine binding to human serum proteins. Protein binding was 
      determined by ultrafiltration with [3H] cocaine. Cocaine binding parameters in serum 
      from eight healthy volunteers were determined over a concentration range of 0.003 to 
      300 microM (0.001-100 micrograms/ml) and indicated cocaine binds to two classes of 
      independent binding sites; one with high affinity [association constant (Ka) = 0.42 
      +/- 0.09 microM-1] and low capacity (N1 = 12.3 +/- 2.9 microM) and one with low 
      affinity and high capacity (gamma = 0.41 +/- 0.05). Binding was concentration 
      dependent with free fraction increasing from 0.16 +/- 0.05 to 0.68 +/- 0.02 over 
      this concentration range. The binding capacity was significantly correlated with 
      alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) concentration (r2 = 0.71, P = .0009). Binding 
      studies were performed using AAG and human serum albumin (HSA) alone and together in 
      phosphate buffer to determine the specific proteins responsible for cocaine binding. 
      These studies revealed the binding of cocaine to AAG is potentiated by the presence 
      of HSA as Ka for the first binding site increased from 0.08 microM-1 with AAG alone 
      to 0.46 microM-1 with AAG combined with HSA 4 g/dl. Binding parameter estimates and 
      cocaine free fraction in human serum and AAG 75 mg/dl plus HSA 4 g/dl in phosphate 
      buffer were similar indicating that AAG and HSA are the principal binding proteins 
      in serum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Dose and schedule determinants of cocaine choice under concurrent variable-interval 
      schedules in rhesus monkeys.
PG  - 274-80
AB  - RATIONALE: Drug abuse can be characterized as a condition in which the choice to 
      self-administer a drug is excessive, even exclusive of the choice of other 
      reinforcers. Under concurrent interval schedules of reinforcement, subjects 
      typically distribute behavior to match reinforcement allocation. However, research 
      has shown that when behavior is maintained by different doses of cocaine under 
      concurrent variable-interval (conc VI) schedules, exclusive choice of the higher 
      dose is the rule. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to examine the 
      generality of this finding to other behavioral conditions. METHODS: Rhesus monkeys ( 
      n=5) lever pressed under a conc VI 60-s VI 60-s or a conc VI 600-s VI 600-s schedule 
      of cocaine (i.v.) presentation. Doses differing by 4-fold (0.025 versus 0.1, 0.05 
      versus 0.2 mg/kg per injection) were available for lever pressing. RESULTS: Monkeys 
      responded more on the lever associated with the higher dose when saline or a lower 
      dose was the alternative. The distribution of responses was well predicted by 
      relative drug intake, but with consistent undermatching. Exclusive high-dose 
      responding was seen in about half of the individual session intervals under the 
      shorter schedule, rarely under the longer schedule, and was not seen over the 
      session. CONCLUSION: Under conc VI schedules, behavior was apportioned between two 
      different doses in a manner that favored the higher dose but undermatched relative 
      intake. Exclusive high-dose choice may occur when cocaine is frequently available 
      but is not an invariable outcome of the choice between a low and a high dose of 
      cocaine.

TI  - Effects of prenatal exposure to cocaine and associated risk factors on language 
      development.
PG  - 1303-18
AB  - During the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in the number of children 
      born with prenatal exposure to cocaine. However, there is very little hard data 
      concerning the later development of these children. The purpose of this preliminary 
      study was to compare the language development profiles of 5 children prenatally 
      exposed to cocaine and associated risk factors to the language development profiles 
      of a matched non-exposed control group in terms of analyses of the 
      discourse-pragmatic, semantic, and form components of language. The language 
      evaluation was based on the analysis of a 30-minute language sample. The results 
      suggested differences between the two groups as well as differences within the 
      cocaine-exposed group. The major differences between the two groups were in 
      discourse-pragmatics although less marked differences in syntactic development were 
      also found. The results are discussed in relation to the potential contribution of 
      pertinent medical and environmental risk factors. The study suggests that for 
      children with prenatal exposure to cocaine in combination with multiple associated 
      risk factors, language development may be compromised.

TI  - Determinants of urinary thioethers, D-glucaric acid and mutagenicity after exposure 
      to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons assessed by air monitoring and measurement of 
      1-hydroxypyrene in urine: a cross-sectional study in workers of coke and 
      graphite-electrode-producing plants.
PG  - 329-38
AB  - A cross-sectional epidemiological study was performed on 286 workers from two coke 
      oven and one graphite electrode plants. The aim was to evaluate the usefulness of 
      monitoring 1-hydroxypyrene (1-HOP) in urine for assessing exposure to polycyclic 
      aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and that of the urinary excretion of thioethers and 
      D-glucaric acid, and the mutagenic activity of urine as indicators or biological 
      effects of PAHs. The results confirm that 1-HOP determination in urine probably 
      reflects exposure to PAHs by all routes and is not significantly influenced by the 
      smoking habit. In comparison with the total PAHs in the air and 1-hydroxypyrene in 
      urine, taken as reference exposure parameters, the results indicate that urinary 
      D-glucaric acid excretion is not positively influenced by PAHs exposure; thioethers 
      determination in urine is of poor value, since the smoking habit is a strong 
      confounding factor. The determination of urinary mutagenicity might contribute to 
      the detection of groups of workers exposed to potentially genotoxic PAHs.

TI  - Prenatal cocaine use: a comparison of neonates matched on maternal risk factors.
PG  - 81-7
AB  - This study was designed to overcome some of the methodological limitations of 
      previous work and investigate the impact of prenatal cocaine use in an understudied 
      population: women using rural county public health units who had minimal access to 
      drug rehabilitation. Through maternal history, interviews, and urine screens, 172 
      cocaine users were identified. Using an independently collected perinatal data base, 
      168 nonusers were matched for six variables known to affect pregnancy outcome and 
      chosen a priori: race, age, parity, prenatal care, alcohol, and nicotine use. To 
      avoid chance findings, 10 adverse perinatal outcome variables were identified 
      prospectively. Cocaine-exposed neonates experienced significantly more of the 
      adverse events than the matched controls and were more likely to be preterm, low 
      birthweight, resuscitated at birth, and to remain in the hospital after their 
      mothers were discharged. We conclude that prenatal cocaine use can be a contributor 
      to adverse perinatal outcome in this population. An understanding of the effects of 
      prenatal cocaine use and the needs of these women and infants is important for 
      designing appropriate prenatal care, treatment, and follow-up programs.

AB  - We conducted a cross sectional study of 3958 college students in north of Iran in 
      2005 with an anonymous questionnaire that was adapted from the questionnaires used 
      in "Monitoring the future". Three thousand seven hundred students responded (93.5%). 
      Lifetime prevalence use of ecstasy, opium and cannabis was 4.3%, 2.7% and 2.4% 
      respectively. The prevalence of current cigarette smoking was 19.5%. After the 
      logistic regression, the factors influencing ecstasy use were use of other illicit 
      drugs, alcohol and cigarette smoking (P<0.000), widow or divorced (ρ=0.007) and 
      higher educational background of mother (ρ=0.019).

TI  - Factors associated with condom use among young adult ecstasy users.
PG  - 571-9
LID - 10.1007/s00038-010-0155-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the prevalence of and the factors associated with 
      condom use in a sample of 283 young adult ecstasy users. METHODS: The study, which 
      relied upon targeted sampling and ethnographic mapping, took place between 2002 and 
      2004. It entailed conducting two-hour-long, face-to-face interviews in the Atlanta, 
      Georgia metropolitan area. RESULTS: Condom use was inconsistent; only 35.2% of all 
      sex acts were protected. Using multiple regression, five factors were related to 
      condom use: race (Caucasians used condoms less than other groups), income (lower 
      income = greater condom use), relationship status (persons involved in relationships 
      reported less condom use than those who were not "involved"), multiple sex partners 
      (multiple sex partners = more condom use), and condom use self-efficacy (higher 
      efficacy level = more condom use). CONCLUSIONS: Condom use rates were not optimal in 
      this population. In particular, targeted interventions are needed for Caucasian 
      ecstasy users. Intervention efforts ought to address relationship (in)fidelity as it 
      pertains to engaging in safer sex practices, especially among persons involved in 
      relationships. Intervention efforts also need to work to increase condom use 
      self-efficacy.

TI  - Crack cocaine and schizophrenia as risk factors for PPD reactivity in the dually 
      diagnosed.
PG  - 63-74
AB  - We studied factors contributing to an increased risk of PPD positive status among 
      147 inpatients dually diagnosed for mental illness and substance abuse in a large 
      urban hospital. Ninety-three percent (N = 137) were tested for PPD on admission. The 
      rate of positive PPDs was 30.7%. Significant correlates of PPD positive status were 
      the diagnosis of schizophrenia/psychosis NOS (p < .05), and crack cocaine use in the 
      30 days prior to admission (p < .01). A multiple logistic regression revealed a 
      relative risk of 3.53 (p < .005) for PPD positive status for the crack using group 
      and a relative risk of 2.16 (p < .06) for PPD positive status for the schizophrenic 
      group. Reasons for why patients whose primary drug of abuse is crack cocaine and 
      those whose diagnosis is schizophrenia/psychosis NOS may be at an increased risk for 
      exposure to tuberculosis are discussed as are the implications for public health.

PG  - 61-7
LID - 10.1159/000339837 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study, which targeted long-term socially integrated cocaine 
      users (in powder form, no heroin), was to analyze potential determinants of request 
      for treatment for primary cocaine abuse. Two hundred and twenty-three cases (users 
      who sought treatment for primary cocaine abuse) and 223 controls (users who did not 
      seek treatment) were interviewed in Italy. A semistructured interview was created. 
      Conditional logistic regression models were used. Cases had begun consuming illicit 
      substances later, started using cocaine quicker, had high-risk drinking habits, had 
      more intense recent use of cocaine, and used alone and at work. Some of the 
      motivations of use that characterize subjects who seek treatment (to experience a 
      'high', disinhibition, avoidance, and to feel more confident) seem specifically to 
      obtain immediate gratification, without concern for future consequences. Variability 
      in cocaine abusers seeking treatment has been a long-recognized feature of this 
      population and the results show that the appropriate target population (cocaine 
      users experiencing problems and using more frequently) is reached by treatment 
      services.

PG  - 825-32
AB  - AIMS: To investigate factors associated with first entry to treatment and with 
      treatment re-entry among cocaine users. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS: Cocaine users (n=313) recruited from community and treatment settings 
      in Brazil. MEASUREMENTS: Structured questionnaire including selected items from the 
      addiction severity index (ASI), general health questionnaire, version 28 (GHQ-28), 
      CAGE and the severity of dependence scale (SDS). FINDINGS: Higher dose use, being a 
      problematic drinker and increased awareness of their problem were associated with 
      increased odds of making first contact with an agency. Greater severity of 
      dependence, being involved in acquisitive crime and social support increased the 
      chance of treatment re-entry. Being involved in acquisitive crimes and concerns 
      about confidentiality were associated with decreased odds of first treatment 
      contact. Being a problematic drinker was associated with decreased odds of re-entry 
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the distinction between first 
      treatment contact and subsequent entry to treatment is useful, clinically relevant 
      and deserving of further investigation.

PG  - 147-53
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to re-evaluate the effects of cocaine on 
      cardiac responses elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation. Cats anesthetized with 
      pentobarbital and subjected to spinal cord transection were used. Control heart rate 
      increases were obtained to submaximal stimulation of postganglionic accelerator 
      nerves, before and after i.v. bolus doses of cocaine ranging from 0.0625 to 2.0 
      mg/kg. Maximal potentiation of heart rate increases elicited by nerve stimulation 
      were observed with 0.25 mg/kg. In precocaine controls, stimulation increased sinus 
      rate by 31 +/- beats/min; 30 sec to 1 min after cocaine (0.25 mg/kg), stimulation 
      increased sinus rate by 55 +/- beats/min. Maximal potentiation (80 +/- 10%) was 
      observed at 30 sec to 1 min after cocaine administration, and was usually over by 45 
      to 60 min later. Cocaine was repeated twice (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) at hourly intervals 
      and the magnitude of potentiation was only 19 +/- 6 and 24 +/- 4%, respectively, 
      indicating that tachyphylaxis had developed toward cocaine's potentiating effect. 
      Dose-response studies indicated that as little as 0.0625 mg/kg of cocaine can 
      potentiate heart rate increases elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation. Doubling 
      the dose to 0.125 mg/kg, and again to 0.25 mg/kg, resulted in a linear dose-related 
      increase in the magnitude of potentiation. However, doubling the dose again to 0.5 
      mg/kg and increasing this dose by 4-fold to 2 mg/kg did not result in additional 
      potentiation. Indeed, there was a significant drop-off in the magnitude of 
      potentiation to nerve stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Determinants of end expiratory volume in young children during ketamine or halothane 
      anesthesia.
PG  - 636-40
AB  - The expiratory time (Te) and the rate of lung emptying in expiration are important 
      determinants of functional residual capacity (FRC) in infants. In order to determine 
      whether these factors also influence FRC in children during anesthesia, 20 preschool 
      children were studied, 10 while receiving ketamine, and 10 during halothane 
      anesthesia. Te was measured during quiet breathing and the passive expiratory time 
      constant (tau) was determined from the passive expiratory flow volume (V/V) curve 
      following a brief end inspiratory airway occlusion. The number of time constants 
      available for expiration, Te/tau, was then calculated. The difference between FRC 
      and the relaxation volume of the respiratory system (Vrs) (FRC-Vrs) was measured by 
      extrapolating the linear segment of the V/V curve to zero flow, and measuring 
      FRC-Vrs. During ketamine anesthesia, tau was markedly prolonged (1.15 s, range 
      0.73-2.29 s), with the result that Te/tau was, in all subjects, less than 2. 
      Children anesthetized with halothane had shorter tau (0.38 s, range 0.24-0.65 s), 
      and Te/tau was more than 2 in most subjects. FRC-Vrs was significantly greater in 
      the subjects from the ketamine group (203 ml, range 115-392 ml) than in those from 
      the halothane group (32 ml, range 1-71 ml). For the 20 subjects, there was a 
      significant relationship between FRC-Vrs (ml) and Te/tau described by the equation. 
      FRC-Vrs = 845.0e-1.28(Te/tau) The authors conclude that, in children during ketamine 
      anesthesia, tau is prolonged and, in these children, the relationship of Te to tau 
      is an important determinant of FRC-Vrs. Te/tau was not related causally to FRC-Vrs 
      in the halothane group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Enriched environment confers resistance to 
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and cocaine: involvement of dopamine 
      transporter and trophic factors.
PG  - 10999-1007
AB  - We investigated, in mice, the influence of life experience on the vulnerability to 
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a major neurotoxin that induces 
      a Parkinson's disease-like syndrome in humans, and to cocaine, a potent 
      psychostimulant that promotes drug addiction. Our findings show that adult C57BL/6 
      mice raised in an enriched environment (EE) for only 2 months are significantly more 
      resistant to both drugs compared with mice raised in a standard environment (SE). 
      Indeed, EE mice showed decreased locomotor activity in response to cocaine (10 and 
      20 mg/kg) as well as a different pattern of c-fos expression in the striatum 
      compared with SE mice. After MPTP treatment, SE mice showed a 75% loss of dopamine 
      neurons, whereas EE mice showed only a 40% loss. The dopamine transporter plays a 
      key role in mediating the effects of both drugs. We thus investigated the regulation 
      of its expression. EE mice showed less dopamine transporter binding in the striatum 
      and less dopamine transporter mRNA per dopamine neuron at the cellular level as 
      demonstrated by in situ hybridization. In addition, enriched environment promoted an 
      increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the striatum. 
      These data provide a direct demonstration of the beneficial consequences that a 
      positive environment has in preventing neurodegeneration and in decreasing 
      responsiveness to cocaine. Furthermore, they suggest that the probability of 
      developing neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease or vulnerability to 
      psychostimulants may be related to life experience.

TI  - Cellular determinants of reduced adaptability of the aging brain: neurotransmitter 
      utilization and cell signaling responses after MDMA lesions.
PG  - 163-73
AB  - Senescence is accompanied by the loss of neurons and synapses, and the maintenance 
      of function depends on adaptive change at the levels of synaptic activity and 
      cellular responsiveness. In the current study, we administered the neurotoxin MDMA, 
      to young and aged mice and assessed the effects on indices of neuronal activity and 
      cell signaling mediated through adenylyl cyclase. Young mice given MDMA showed 80% 
      depletion of dopamine in the caudate and 30% depletion in the cerebral cortex; 
      measurements of dopamine turnover indicated a compensatory upregulation of the 
      activity of the remaining neurons in the caudate but downregulation in the cerebral 
      cortex. Serotonin levels were comparatively less affected but serotonin turnover was 
      decreased significantly in both regions. At the level of cell signaling, the young 
      mice showed heterologous upregulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and a consequent 
      enhancement of responses mediated through neurotransmitter receptors. In aged mice, 
      MDMA treatment produced the same degree of lesioning but substantially different 
      changes in neuronal activity and cell signaling. In the cerebral cortex, dopamine 
      turnover was increased, and serotonin turnover decreased, effects opposite in 
      direction to those seen in young mice. In the aged group, MDMA elicited heterologous 
      loss of adenylyl cyclase responses instead of displaying the supersensitivity that 
      had been seen in the young group. The aging brain thus displays maladaptation to the 
      loss of monoaminergic input, effects that may augment the functional impairment 
      associated with neurodegenerative disorders or stroke.

AB  - This study examined ecstasy use and associated risk and protective factors among 
      Asian American youth. Data from 996 Asian American adolescents and 1,108 Asian 
      American young adults were used. Ecstasy use was relatively common among Asian 
      American youth. Among adolescents, it was associated with older age, poor 
      parent-child communication, having been approached by drug sellers, living in a 
      metropolitan area, and positive attitudes toward substance use. Among Asian American 
      young adults, it was associated with having been born in the United States, having 
      been approached by drug sellers, criminal justice system involvement, and positive 
      attitudes toward substance use. Implications for designing substance use 
      prevention/intervention programs for this minority group are discussed.

TI  - Chronic cocaine administration modulates the expression of transcription factors 
      involved in midbrain dopaminergic neuron function.
PG  - 472-80
AB  - Chronic cocaine use leads to pronounced alterations in neuronal functions in brain 
      circuits associated with reward. In the present study, we examined in the rat 
      midbrain the effects of acute, subchronic (5 days) and chronic cocaine treatments 
      (14 days) on the gene expression of transcription factors involved in the 
      development and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons. We show that chronic, but not 
      acute or subchronic, cocaine administration downregulates Nurr1 and Pitx3 
      transcripts whereas En1 transcripts are upregulated. Conversely, Lmx1b and En2 
      transcripts are not affected by the drug treatment, indicating that the modulation 
      of the midbrain transcription factors analyzed is highly selective. Interestingly, 
      modification of the gene expression for these transcription factors persists in 
      midbrain as long as two weeks after the last drug administration, suggesting that it 
      may account for some of the enduring alterations in midbrain dopaminergic circuits 
      associated with chronic cocaine use.

AB  - A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 1541 HIV-infected patients to 
      determine variables associated with the incidence of herpes zoster. A single failure 
      Cox model showed that herpes zoster incidence increased following the first 6 months 
      of antiretroviral treatment adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=5 (95%CI=2.6-9.2), P<0.001; 
      in the >60 years age group AHR=2 (95%CI=1-4), P=0.04; in patients in the top CD8 
      quartile AHR=2.1 (95%CI=1.3-3.6), P<0.001; and in patients previously reported to 
      use crack cocaine AHR=5.9, (95%CI=1.4-25), P=0.02. Herpes zoster incidence increased 
      in patients with CD4 counts<500 per mm(3) and gradually declined since 1992-1996, 
      with AHR=0.3 (95%CI=0.2-0.5), P<0.001 for the 1997-2002 period and AHR=0.24 
      (95%CI=0.14-0.4), P<0.001 for the 2002-2008 period. Contrary to what has been 
      described elsewhere, there was no specific effect of protease inhibitors on herpes 
      zoster incidence. The present study is the first to suggest that crack cocaine is 
      associated with an increased incidence of herpes zoster. The neurological or 
      immunological effects of crack are discussed.

TI  - Psychological and environmental determinants of relapse in crack cocaine smokers.
PG  - 95-106
AB  - The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. 
      Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, 
      recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use 
      drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical 
      technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes 
      a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack 
      cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a 
      second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state 
      (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with 
      conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology 
      and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. 
      Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper 
      educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique 
      necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts 
      probable relapse situations.

TI  - State-dependent peculiarities of cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization and their 
      possible reasons.
PG  - 93-103
AB  - To study determinants and possible reasons of cocaine-induced behavioral 
      sensitization, locomotor effects of the drug (COC, 15 mg/kg, IP; 5 daily injections 
      followed by a "challenge," four days later) and various stimuli associated 
      (procedure of injection, placement in the test cage) and nonassociated (tail-pinch) 
      with its administration were measured in rats under different experimental 
      conditions. When COC was injected in quite conditions, two hours after animal 
      habituation to the test cages, locomotor response to the first drug injection was 
      only slightly higher compared to one of saline and these responses were relatively 
      stable following repeated treatment (no sensitization). An enhanced locomotor 
      response to the procedure of injection (needle prick) without changes in 
      responsivity to other stimuli used were found in these COC-treated rats. When COC 
      was injected in activated conditions (animal placement in test cages), locomotor 
      response to the first drug administration was significantly higher compared to one 
      of saline and COC used in the quiet state and it was enhanced following repeated 
      treatment (sensitization). More intense locomotion associated with placement in test 
      cages without any changes in responses to other stimuli was found in rats after this 
      procedure of treatment. Thus, locomotor effects of COC and dynamics of its changes 
      following repeated treatment depend upon the organism's functional state 
      accompanying the drug's effect. Reinforcing action of COC determining development of 
      interinfluence of its effects and ones triggered by environmental variables 
      (learning based on conditioning) is considered as a proposed initial cause and a 
      main mechanism both for enhanced reactivity to cocaine administered under conditions 
      of its previous use and to various environmental events associated with previous 
      cocaine effects.

TI  - Multiple risk factors do not identify cocaine use in rural obstetrical patients.
PG  - 479-84
AB  - This nonconcurrent, cohort study of consecutive admissions to one of three hospital 
      units: labor and delivery (n = 474), well-born nursery (n = 100), and the neonatal 
      intensive care unit (n = 100), was designed to determine the prevalence of cocaine 
      exposure in a rural obstetrical sample and to determine the relationship between 
      exposure and perinatal variables. Urines were analyzed for benzoylecgonine, and the 
      Obstetrical Complications Scale was completed for each mother-infant pair. 
      Elementary comparisons were made using chi 2 analyses and Student's t test. Stepwise 
      discriminant and discriminant function analyses were performed. The prevalence of 
      exposure in the three groups of subjects ranged from 5%-7%. No significant 
      differences in perinatal variables were found between users and nonusers in either 
      of the newborn samples. In the maternal sample the groups differed on twelve mother 
      or infant factors. However, no single variable or set of variables predicted use 
      versus nonuse in any of the groups.

TI  - A longitudinal analysis of factors associated with morbidity in cocaine abusers with 
      psychiatric illness.
PG  - 114-8
AB  - We conducted a study to characterize a population of cocaine users who were referred 
      to a state psychiatric institution, identify treatment problems including reasons 
      for relapse, and develop strategies to improve treatment outcome. Using a data base 
      system from a tertiary-care hospital emergency department, we identified a sample of 
      80 patients with a cocaine-related presentation who came to the emergency department 
      and were referred to the psychiatric facility. Forty-six percent had consumed crack 
      cocaine, and 65% reported ingesting cocaine with other drugs, half of them with 
      alcohol. Suicidal ideation or attempt was the most common reason for referral. A 
      retrospective review of 58 of the 80 referrals to the psychiatric facility showed 
      that over half of the patients were given a concurrent psychiatric diagnosis and 
      required hospitalization on an acute-care psychiatric unit. Sixty-two percent of 
      those admitted had prior hospitalizations at the psychiatric facility, yet only five 
      patients had received treatment for substance abuse. Seventy-four percent were 
      readmitted to the psychiatric facility within 1 year of their index episode, with a 
      higher rate of relapse among persons with dual diagnoses compared to cocaine users 
      without dual diagnoses (p less than 0.05). Possible reasons for relapse included 
      lack of referral for substance abuse treatment, nonintegrated treatment of 
      psychiatric illness and substance abuse, lack of psychosocial support, and 
      unresolved financial or job-related stressors. The data support increased funding to 
      facilities that treat persons with dual diagnoses, and suggest the need to develop 
      comprehensive treatment approaches involving a multidisciplinary team to address 
      issues of mental illness and substance abuse concomitantly, and to identify and 
      resolve stressors leading to relapse.

PG  - 659-63
AB  - We analyzed 26 autopsy cases of cocaine induced intracerebral hemorrhage and 
      compared those findings with those of 26 autopsy cases of cocaine induced cerebral 
      aneurysm rupture. The incidence of hypertensive cardiovascular disease (HCVD) was 
      significantly higher in persons with intracerebral hemorrhage than in those with 
      aneurysm rupture. Our findings suggest that HCVD predisposes to cocaine induced 
      intracerebral hemorrhage. We propose that the foregoing relationship results from a 
      cocaine induced alteration of cerebral autoregulation in the context of increased 
      cerebral blood flow.

PG  - 204-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study factors that influence the self-reported use of condoms among 
      injection drug users and crack smokers. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was 
      used to collect data from drug-using heterosexual men (n = 247) and women (n = 107). 
      RESULTS: Participants were largely African American (79.4%), male (69.8%), and 
      unmarried (90.1%). The mean age for men was 39.9 years, 35.5 years for women. Drug 
      user groups consisted of individuals who used both crack cocaine and injection drugs 
      (40.1%), noninjecting crack smokers (33.1%), and non-crack-smoking injection drug 
      users (26.8%). Daily injection drug or crack use was reported by 62.9% of the 
      sample. One third of the sample reported recent vaginal sex with more than one 
      partner. More than 70% of the participants frequently used drugs when having sex. 
      Logistic regression showed that individuals who were high when having vaginal sex 
      were less likely to use condoms than people who were not high (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 
      95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.99); individuals whose partners got high when 
      having sex were more likely to report condom use (OR 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42); 
      individuals were less likely to use condoms when having sex with a main partner (OR 
      0.40; 95% CI, 0.20-0.80); individuals who believed it was important to use condoms 
      were more likely to use condoms (beta = 0.57, P < 0.00); and people who believed 
      condoms reduced sexual pleasure were less likely to use condoms (beta = -0.53, P < 
      0.00). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to being sensitive to partner characteristics, sex 
      risk-reduction interventions targeting users of injection drugs or crack must 
      address the widespread use of psychoactive drugs that occurs immediately before and 
      during sex because such use presents a significant impediment to the employment of 
      safer-sex techniques that rely on condoms. Until such interventions are in place, 
      access to drug abuse treatment is a critical dimension of human immunodeficiency 
      virus and other sexually transmitted disease prevention.

TI  - Importance of post-drug environmental factors for induction of sensitization to the 
      ambulation-increasing effects of methamphetamine and cocaine in mice.
PG  - 293-300
AB  - Mice given five repeated administrations of methamphetamine (MAP: 2 mg/kg SC) or 
      cocaine (COC: 20 mg/kg SC) at 3-day intervals in a round tilting-type activity cage 
      (20 cm in diameter) showed sensitization to the ambulation-increasing effect of each 
      drug. The mean 3- or 2-h overall activity count at the fifth administration of MAP 
      or COC, respectively, was 2.3-2.5 times higher than that at the first 
      administration. Mice given MAP or COC 4 times in round spaces (15-30 cm in 
      diameter), where the floor did not tilt, exhibited sensitization as strong as that 
      demonstrated by mice given each drug in the activity cages, when the mice were given 
      the fifth administration in the activity cages. In contrast, mice repeatedly given 
      the drugs in spaces 4-9 cm in diameter never, and those in space 12 cm in diameter 
      only partially, exhibited sensitization to MAP and COC. Furthermore, mice given MAP 
      or COC 4 times in their home cages (25D x 20W x 15H cm, with ten mice in each cage) 
      showed partial sensitization. Repeated administration of saline to mice in activity 
      cages, in the spaces 4-30 cm in diameter, or in the home cages did not cause 
      significant change in the sensitivity to either MAP or COC. These results suggest 
      that repeated experience of the stimulant effect of drug and the resultant 
      ambulation is required for induction of sensitization to MAP and COC in terms of 
      ambulation in mice. It is also suggested that spaces larger than 12 cm in diameter, 
      which correspond to 2-2.5 times as long as the body length without tail, and no 
      interference from other mice are required for induction of strong sensitization to 
      both MAP and COC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore empirically the presence of certain To explore empirically the 
      presence of certain factors as risk elements for cocaine consumption. METHOD: 
      Analysis of the data obtained in a set of items that measure the variables of the 
      Planned Behavior Theory (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and 
      behavioral intention) in three groups: Group A is made up of 192 cocaine users 
      without treatment, Group B comprises 110 cocaine users in treatment, and Group C is 
      made up of 100 individuals who had never used cocaine. RESULTS: Group A scored 
      significantly higher in all the variables, while Group C was which obtained the 
      lowest scores. Group B showed no significant differences from Group A in the 
      subjective norm variable, nor from Group C in the perceived behavioral control and 
      behavioral intention variables. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the importance of 
      attitudes and subjective norm in the explanation of current cocaine use, but 
      especially the function of perceived behavioral control as a risk factor that should 
      be taken into account in the design of preventive strategies.

TI  - Genetic factors influence changes in sensitivity to the convulsant properties of 
      cocaine following chronic treatment.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Repeated administration of doses of cocaine below the threshold for seizure 
      induction results in the development of an increased susceptibility to 
      cocaine-induced seizures (cocaine-kindling). Genetic differences in susceptibility 
      to cocaine-kindled seizures were evaluated in 4 inbred mouse strains and compared 
      with susceptibility to seizures induced by acute administration of cocaine. The 
      acute administration of cocaine produced convulsant activity in mice from all 4 
      genotypes, however, there were significant differences in the dose of cocaine 
      required to induce seizures. C57 mice were highly susceptible and SJL mice highly 
      resistant to convulsions induced by acute administration of cocaine, while BALB and 
      DBA mice showed an intermediate degree of seizure susceptibility. The repeated 
      administration of subconvulsant doses of cocaine resulted in rapid sensitization to 
      cocaine-induced seizures. The 4 strains differed in the rate at which sensitization 
      to cocaine-induced seizures developed, with the SJL strain being most sensitive and 
      the C57 strain the least sensitive to the cocaine-kindling process. The 
      susceptibility of the 4 strains to cocaine kindling was virtually opposite to their 
      susceptibility to seizures induced by the acute administration of cocaine, 
      suggesting that different mechanisms may be involved in the control of acute and 
      kindled seizures did not persist upon further exposure to cocaine. Following a 
      period of increased sensitivity to cocaine-induced seizures, tolerance to the 
      convulsant properties of cocaine developed among C57, BALB and DBA mice. Only among 
      the SJL mice did the development of a kindled state persist upon repeated exposure 
      to cocaine. These differences emphasize the potential importance of inheritance in 
      determining the effects of cocaine and suggest novel approaches to understanding the 
      the mechanisms underlying the effects of cocaine.

      Crack Cocaine and HIV Infection Study Team.
PG  - 85-92
AB  - A survey of 1220 street-recruited crack cocaine smokers revealed that crack smokers 
      may turn to drug injection to ease crack withdrawal. Crack smokers who later 
      injected tended to smoke crack more heavily and for longer periods than those who 
      did not inject. The initiation of injection was significantly associated with ever 
      snorting heroin (prevalence ratio [PR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
      2.0-5.9) or snorting heroin specifically while smoking crack (PR = 2.3, 95% CI = 
      1.3-4.0), suggesting that snorted heroin use may mediate the transition to injection 
      among crack smokers. Programs to prevent and treat crack dependence may prevent 
      later injection and injection-related infections including HIV.

TI  - Fetal gender and cocaine exposure as determinants of cord blood gamma-glutamyl 
      transferase activity.
PG  - 133-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The serum activity of the hepatic enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 
      is elevated in the newborn relative to older age groups. Few reports to date have 
      studied the influence of perinatal factors on neonatal serum GGT and no study has 
      assessed the influence of maternal drug ingestion. STUDY DESIGN: Cord blood was 
      randomly collected from 234 liveborn infants and correlated with a range of maternal 
      and fetal perinatal variables to assess influences on cord blood GGT. RESULTS: Our 
      study showed that the range of cord blood GGT activity in 234 randomly selected term 
      newborns was 22 to 556 IU/l. In a subgroup of 75 newborns, GGT activity was 
      independently influenced by only two of the variables studied - cocaine exposure and 
      fetal gender (p=0.009, r=0.39). Females had a lower GGT than males (95+/-66 vs 
      130+/-90 IU/l, p<0.001) while GGT activity in cocaine-exposed newborns was lower 
      than in cocaine-nonexposed newborns (96+/-48 vs 142+/-109, p<0.01). Birth weight, 
      race, gestational age, and maternal serum GGT were not found to significantly 
      influence cord blood GGT activity. Maternal GGT was uniformly normal and was not 
      affected by any of the variables tested. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that 
      the reference range for cord blood GGT activity is wide and appears to be influenced 
      by fetal gender and cocaine exposure.

TI  - Mothers recovering from cocaine addiction: factors affecting parenting skills.
PG  - 71-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that may influence parenting by mothers who are 
      recovering from cocaine addiction. DESIGN: Exploratory descriptive, with in-depth 
      unstructured interviews. SETTING: Interviews were conducted in the woman's home or 
      in a treatment center. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 11 women recovering 
      from cocaine addiction who were mothers of children 3 years of age and younger. 
      RESULTS: A content analysis was used to analyze the interview data. Two themes, 
      personal/psychologic factors and environmental/contextual factors, and four 
      subthemes emerged. They identify issues that may affect parenting by mothers being 
      treated for cocaine addiction. Subthemes included low self-esteem, difficulty 
      developing a maternal identity, isolation from friends and family, and chronic life 
      stress. CONCLUSION: This study provides a better understanding of the sources 
      contributing to vulnerability in the parenting role for mothers recovering from 
      cocaine addiction and will assist nurses in providing care for these mothers and 
      their children.

TI  - Looking back on cocaine dependence: reasons for recovery.
PG  - 398-411
AB  - Factors that contributed to long-term recovery from cocaine dependence were examined 
      as part of a 5-year national follow-up study of 708 patients from 45 treatment 
      programs in eight U.S. cities. Outcomes from 33% of the sample were highly favorable 
      at follow-up, including no drugs detected in urine or hair specimens, no 
      self-reported use of any drugs, less than daily alcohol use, and no illegal activity 
      or arrests during the past year. Major reasons cited for these improvements were 
      motivations to change, positive influences of family, strength from religion and 
      spirituality, and help from drug treatment. "Recovery" was viewed as a continuous 
      process and one that benefits from lessons learned in treatment. These retrospective 
      attributions affirm many of the same findings from prospective outcome studies and 
      contribute to a conceptual framework for treatment process and recovery.

TI  - Examination of factors mediating the transition to behaviorally correlated nucleus 
      accumbens cell firing during cocaine self-administration sessions in rats.
PG  - 127-39
AB  - We have previously reported that at the initiation of cocaine self-administration 
      sessions, neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NA) exhibit a spontaneous transition in 
      firing rate from activity unrelated to the reinforced response, to one of four types 
      of patterned discharges (Carelli RM, King VC, Hampson RE, Deadwyler SA. Firing 
      patterns of nucleus accumbens neurons during cocaine self-administration in rats. 
      Brain Res 1993;626:14-22; Carelli RM, Deadwyler SA. Dose-dependent transitions in 
      nucleus accumbens cell firing and behavioral responding during cocaine 
      self-administration sessions in rats. J Pharm Exp Ther 1996;277(1):385 393; Carelli 
      RM, Deadwyler SA. Cellular mechanisms underlying reinforcement-related processing in 
      the nucleus accumbens: electrophysiological studies in behaving animals. Pharmacol 
      Biochem Behav 1997;57:(2)1-10). This transition in NA cell firing is cocaine 
      dose-dependent and is accompanied by a shift from high response rates at the start 
      of the session ('Load-up' behavior) to a lower steady rate of responding thereafter 
      (termed 'Session' phase responding). Two experiments were conducted to examine 
      further factors that may mediate this process. Experiment 1 examined the effects of 
      pre-session, response-independent delivery of cocaine on behavioral/neural 
      transitions. Results revealed an absence of Load-up responding and the immediate 
      onset of NA patterned activity at the start of the session. Experiment 2 examined 
      the involvement of dopamine D1 versus D2 receptors in mediating the corresponding 
      behavioral/neural transitions. Animals were pretreated with either saline, the 
      dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (2.5-20 microg/kg, s.c.), or the dopamine 
      D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride (2.5-20 microg/kg, s.c.) 30 min prior to the 
      cocaine (0.33 mg/inf) self-administration session. SCH23390 significantly increased 
      the number of Load-up responses at 10 and 20 microg/kg and the number of responses 
      following the Load-up phase (i.e. during the Session phase) at 5, 10, and 20 
      microg/kg. Eticlopride increased the number of Session responses (5, 10, and 20 
      microg/kg), but did not alter the number of Load-up responses at any dose tested. 
      The transition in NA cell firing corresponded with the shift in behavioral 
      responding and was delayed within the session following SCH23390 but not eticlopride 
      pretreatment. These findings support the notion that cocaine self-administration 
      sessions in rats consists of two distinct behavioral phases that are mediated by 
      different neurophysiological mechanisms operating in the NA.

TI  - Parametric determinants in pre-stimulus modification of acoustic startle: 
      interaction with ketamine.
PG  - 162-8
AB  - Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response is a form of reflex 
      modification known to be sensitive to drugs and to subtle procedural manipulations. 
      The present study examined the importance of prepulse length and prepulse-pulse 
      interval in the expression of prepulse inhibition and its modification by the 
      noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, ketamine. In contrast to a previous 
      report, ketamine disrupted prepulse inhibition at doses of 5.6 and 10 mg/kg when its 
      short time course was taken into consideration. In a second experiment, the amount 
      of prepulse inhibition was found to be directly related to prepulse length, with 
      prepulse inhibition produced by shorter prepulse durations slightly more sensitive 
      to disruption by ketamine. A third experiment examined prepulse-pulse time intervals 
      (30-2000 ms). While prepulse inhibition produced by prepulses occurring 60-500 ms 
      before the startle stimulus was disrupted by 10 mg/kg of ketamine, prepulses 
      preceding the startle stimulus by only 30 ms produced either no effect or slight 
      prepulse facilitation under control conditions, and significant prepulse 
      facilitation when ketamine was administered. A fourth experiment examined the time 
      course of prestimulus modification by continuous lead stimuli, ranging in onset from 
      15 to 75 ms before the startle stimulus. Prepulse facilitation, when observed, 
      tended to occur in earlier portions of the session and was enhanced by ketamine. 
      These results suggest that prestimulus modification of the startle reflex has 
      important parametric and experiential determinants that may influence the effects of 
      drugs. Some of these temporal determinants may have relevance to sensorimotor 
      function in schizophrenia.

TI  - To use or to refuse cocaine--the deciding factors.
PG  - 293-310
AB  - Two types of narratives were obtained from 35 cocaine-addicted patients: narratives 
      about using cocaine and narratives about not using cocaine. The most prevalent 
      factors in using cocaine were (a) having enough money, (b) wish to end 
      physical/emotional pain, and (c) wish/decision to use. The factors in narratives 
      about not using cocaine were (a) patient arranged conditions to be nonstimulating 
      for using cocaine, (b) recognition of bad consequences, and (c) wish/decision not to 
      use. It is clear in both the cocaine-using episodes and not-using episodes that the 
      patient's wish/decision is important. The conditions for using cocaine tended to be 
      more external, whereas those for not using tended to be more internal. Similar 
      conditions were found by a questionnaire method. A major treatment implication of 
      these findings is that the focus of therapy can be directed to planning strategies 
      to minimize influence of the external factors and to rehearse strategies to prepare 
      for situations involving cues that influence use of cocaine.

TI  - Effect of cocaine on vagal tone: a common factors approach.
PG  - 211-6
AB  - This paper discusses a distinct cardiovascular pattern that is common to a wide 
      variety of abused substances. The pattern consists of tachycardia that appears 
      mediated by withdrawal of vagal inhibition, as indicated by decreases in cardiac 
      vagal tone. This decrease in vagal tone was particularly robust with i.v. cocaine 
      given to experienced cocaine abusers in a residential research setting. Following 40 
      mg i.v. cocaine, heart rate increased by approximately 30 beats/min at the same time 
      that vagal tone decreased by approximately 2 log units. The theoretical significance 
      of these findings is based on evidence that the results reflect a common factor 
      among many abused drugs, but not the few aversive drugs that have been studied in 
      this paradigm.

TI  - Individual differences in sensitivity to factors provoking reinstatement of 
      cocaine-seeking behavior.
PG  - 157-61
AB  - Among cocaine addicts, there is a strong variation in response to relapse provoking 
      factors like conditioned cues and renewed contact with the drug. Here we show that 
      such large individual differences also exist in rats. Reinstatement of extinguished 
      cocaine-seeking behavior was triggered by contingent presentation of a 
      cocaine-conditioned cue or an amphetamine priming injection. We found no positive 
      correlation between cue- and drug-controlled reinstatement of cocaine seeking. 
      Rather, a slight, but significant negative correlation was observed, which was 
      particularly evident in two subgroups of rats that responded highest following 
      either amphetamine priming or cue presentation. A large middle group responded 
      equally for both relapse provoking factors. Further, cocaine-seeking behavior during 
      the first extinction session correlated positively with cue-induced reinstatement. 
      In conclusion, the present findings indicate that the therapeutic efficacy of 
      relapse prevention strategies may depend on individual sensitivity to distinct 
      relapse provoking stimuli.

TI  - Patient factors related to early attrition from an outpatient cocaine research 
      clinic.
PG  - 29-39
AB  - The dropout rates among cocaine abusers in outpatient treatment programs have 
      averaged 55%. We sought to find patient predictor variables associated with early 
      attrition. Dropouts were more likely to be African-American or Hispanic-American, 
      younger, with an earlier onset of substance abuse. Among minorities, those with more 
      education were less likely to drop out. Patients who were less educated and smoked 
      or injected cocaine were particularly prone to discontinue treatment prematurely. 
      The implications of these findings, and promising interventions for reducing the 
      dropout problem, are discussed.

TI  - [Mental disorders as risk factors for the development of cocaine abuse/dependence: 
      case-control study].
PG  - 477-86
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of psychiatric disorders and alcohol dependence as 
      possible risk factors for cocaine abuse/dependence. METHODS: The case-control study 
      used the "snowball" technique in order to select untreated cocaine users (cases) and 
      to match sex, age and friendship. Information was gathered using the Composite 
      International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), and computer diagnosis were generated 
      according to the DSM-III-R criteria. The analysis was performed through the logistic 
      conditional regression. RESULTS: The study included 208 subjects. The main results 
      showed that having a history of alcohol dependence was independently associated with 
      an increased risk of cocaine abuse/dependence (OR=15,1; 95% CI 3,8-60, 2); no other 
      psychiatric disorder was significantly associated with an increase in this risk 
      after the multivariate analysis. An increased risk of cocaine abuse/dependence was 
      also found for those who related suicide thoughts (OR=3,1; 95% CI 0,91-10,8), 
      suggesting an association between more severe manifestations of depression and 
      cocaine abuse. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that programs directed towards 
      the treatment and prevention of cocaine abuse must be prepared to address issues 
      related to comorbidity of drug abuse with alcohol and other psychiatric disorders

AB  - This study compares a sample of cocaine users in drug treatment programs to a sample 
      of cocaine users not in treatment. These samples were compared on: (1) level of 
      cocaine use, (2) consequences of user, (3) employment, (4) social support system, 
      and (5) criminal behavior. These attributes were related to being in treatment. 
      Among intermediate-level cocaine users, friendship patterns, employment, and 
      criminal history were associated with treatment status. The implications for the 
      treatment of cocaine use are addressed.

TI  - Developmental risk factors in postpartum women with urine tests positive for 
      cocaine.
PG  - 187-97
AB  - The aim of the study was to ascertain whether there was a difference in 
      developmental experiences between two groups of inner city postpartum patients, 
      those who used cocaine during pregnancy and those who did not. A retrospective 
      structured interview was administered to 80 postpartum women examining demographic 
      characteristics, adaptive function, drug use patterns, and selected risk factors for 
      adult substance abuse encountered before age 16. The sample was divided into two 
      cohorts of women: 40 women identified by urine tests of their babies as using 
      cocaine shortly before delivery and a comparison group of 40 women not identified by 
      positive urines. Comparisons between the two cohorts revealed that the cocaine 
      identified women had significantly higher overall past and present use of a broad 
      range of drugs, particularly crack and other forms of cocaine, as well as lower 
      levels of general adaptive functioning despite the fact that they were 
      demographically comparable. When compared to the nonusers, they displayed markedly 
      elevated scores on measures of developmental risk factors for adult substance use. 
      This study highlights the importance of early developmental risk factors on later 
      drug use during pregnancy and general adult adaptive functioning. Further study and 
      intervention targeted at persons with these risk factors are warranted.

TI  - Temporal determinants of intravenous cocaine self-administration in rhesus monkeys'.
PG  - 317-326
AB  - The operant behavior of four rhesus monkeys was studies during 1-h sessions in which 
      intravenous cocaine or saline was available on a fixed-ratio 10 schedule of 
      reinforcement. Examination of the temporal characteristics of the behavior revealed 
      differences between drug and saline, and between the two doses of cocaine, 33 and 
      100 µg/kg/infusion. Rates of saline self-administration decreased rapidly after the 
      first 15 min of the session, whereas rates of cocaine-maintained responding changed 
      less in successive segments of the session. The frequency of inter-infusion times 
      (IITs) falling into successive 30-sec bins confirmed that short IITs were likely to 
      be produced, but a substantial proportion of very long IITs also occurred when 
      saline or a high (100 µg/kg/infusion) dose of cocaine was the available substance. 
      The occurrence of intermediate inter-infusion times was low under all test 
      conditions. The results of an IIT-per-opportunity analysis also suggested that the 
      selection of IITs by the monkeys was orderly and dose-related. Examination of IIT 
      distributions during successive 15-min portions of the session revealed a 
      progressive shift in the relative probabilities of different IITs; however, the 
      occurrence of short IITs late in the session suggested that the negatively 
      accelerating rate of drug self-administration was not a consequence of response 
      disruption. The latencies to the first five infusions of the session were markedly 
      different between saline and 33 µ/kg/infusion of cocaine, suggesting that the drug's 
      effects were manifested at a very early stage of the session. Individual differences 
      were also apparent. These results suggest a temporal complexity in drug 
      self-administration behavior which may help to explain some of its determinants. 
      Examination of such temporal indices may be helpful in the laboratory study of 
      drug-taking behavior.

TI  - Risk factors for HIV-1 seroprevalence among drug injectors in the cocaine-using 
      environment of Rio de Janeiro.
PG  - 689-98
AB  - To determine risk factors for HIV-1 among drug injectors in Rio de Janeiro, where 
      cocaine is the dominant drug of injection, subjects were recruited using the 
      criteria and interview instrument of the World Health Organization's Cross-National 
      Study of HIV infection and risk behaviour in injecting drug users. HIV antibody test 
      results were derived both from serum tests and from self-reports of previous tests 
      (documented evidence of self-reported seropositivity was required). The analytical 
      sample consists of 123 subjects, recruited both at drug abuse treatment sites and at 
      street locations. Of 27 subjects with both serological and self-reported antibody 
      status data, 20 reported previous negative tests; of these three had positive sera 
      and may have seroconverted. Seven subjects reporting prior positive serostatus all 
      tested positive. For the 123 subjects, seroprevalence was 34%. Independent 
      significant risk factors in multivariate logistic regression with backwards 
      elimination are: years of injection greater than 5; being a male who has had sex 
      with men in the previous 5 years; and not having taken deliberate steps to protect 
      oneself against AIDS. These findings indicate that homosexual/bisexual male drug 
      injectors may be a bridge group through which HIV is entering drug-injecting 
      networks in Rio de Janeiro. Efforts by drug injectors to reduce their risk of 
      infection seem to have protective effects. This underscores the importance of HIV 
      prevention efforts aimed at drug injectors.

AB  - Of 60 cocaine misusers seeking outpatient treatment, 33 (55%) dropped out by 4 
      weeks. Dropouts were more likely to be male, Black or Hispanic, or with no history 
      of primary depression. Completers were more likely to be White, female, or 
      depressed. The implications of these findings and possible strategies for reducing 
      the dropout rate are discussed.

AB  - The investigations, carried out by the institute of Hygiene and Occupational 
      Diseases, for the assessment of toxic-chemical and physical factors of the working 
      environment in the metallurgical-chemical plant showed a high degree of air 
      pollution with dust and high number of toxic substances, many of them manifestating 
      an additive effect or effect of synergism. At certain working places the physical 
      factors have manifested deleterious effect. On the base of the investigations 
      carried out, recommendations are proposed for further investigations on proper 
      assessment of the occupational risk and improvement of labour conditions.

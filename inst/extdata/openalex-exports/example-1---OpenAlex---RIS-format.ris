AB  - Abstract Objectives To investigate the validity of data extraction in systematic reviews of adverse events, the effect of data extraction errors on the results, and to develop a classification framework for data extraction errors to support further methodological research. Design Reproducibility study. Data sources PubMed was searched for eligible systematic reviews published between 1 January 2015 and 1 January 2020. Metadata from the randomised controlled trials were extracted from the systematic reviews by four authors. The original data sources (eg, full text and ClinicalTrials.gov) were then referred to by the same authors to reproduce the data used in these meta-analyses. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Systematic reviews were included when based on randomised controlled trials for healthcare interventions that reported safety as the exclusive outcome, with at least one pair meta-analysis that included five or more randomised controlled trials and with a 2×2 table of data for event counts and sample sizes in intervention and control arms available for each trial in the meta-analysis. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was data extraction errors summarised at three levels: study level, meta-analysis level, and systematic review level. The potential effect of such errors on the results was further investigated. Results 201 systematic reviews and 829 pairwise meta-analyses involving 10 386 randomised controlled trials were included. Data extraction could not be reproduced in 1762 (17.0%) of 10 386 trials. In 554 (66.8%) of 829 meta-analyses, at least one randomised controlled trial had data extraction errors; 171 (85.1%) of 201 systematic reviews had at least one meta-analysis with data extraction errors. The most common types of data extraction errors were numerical errors (49.2%, 867/1762) and ambiguous errors (29.9%, 526/1762), mainly caused by ambiguous definitions of the outcomes. These categories were followed by three others: zero assumption errors, misidentification, and mismatching errors. The impact of these errors were analysed on 288 meta-analyses. Data extraction errors led to 10 (3.5%) of 288 meta-analyses changing the direction of the effect and 19 (6.6%) of 288 meta-analyses changing the significance of the P value. Meta-analyses that had two or more different types of errors were more susceptible to these changes than those with only one type of error (for moderate changes, 11 (28.2%) of 39 v 26 (10.4%) 249, P=0.002; for large changes, 5 (12.8%) of 39 v 8 (3.2%) of 249, P=0.01). Conclusion Systematic reviews of adverse events potentially have serious issues in terms of the reproducibility of the data extraction, and these errors can mislead the conclusions. Implementation guidelines are urgently required to help authors of future systematic reviews improve the validity of data extraction.

AB  - Abstract Data extraction is a crucial, yet labor-intensive and error-prone part of evidence synthesis. To date, efforts to harness machine learning for enhancing efficiency of the data extraction process have fallen short of achieving sufficient accuracy and usability. With the release of large language models (LLMs), new possibilities have emerged to increase efficiency and accuracy of data extraction for evidence synthesis. The objective of this proof-of-concept study was to assess the performance of an LLM (Claude 2) in extracting data elements from published studies, compared with human data extraction as employed in systematic reviews. Our analysis utilized a convenience sample of 10 English-language, open-access publications of randomized controlled trials included in a single systematic review. We selected 16 distinct types of data, posing varying degrees of difficulty (160 data elements across 10 studies). We used the browser version of Claude 2 to upload the portable document format of each publication and then prompted the model for each data element. Across 160 data elements, Claude 2 demonstrated an overall accuracy of 96.3% with a high test-retest reliability (replication 1: 96.9%; replication 2: 95.0% accuracy). Overall, Claude 2 made 6 errors on 160 data items. The most common errors ( n = 4) were missed data items. Importantly, Claude 2's ease of use was high; it required no technical expertise or labeled training data for effective operation (i.e., zero-shot learning). Based on findings of our proof-of-concept study, leveraging LLMs has the potential to substantially enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data extraction for evidence syntheses.

AB  - Data extraction is the foundation for research synthesis evidence, while data extraction errors frequently occur in the literature. An interesting phenomenon was observed that data extraction error tend to be more common in trials of pharmaceutical interventions compared to non-pharmaceutical ones. The elucidation of which would have implications for guidelines, practice, and policy.We propose a crossover, multicenter, investigator-blinded trial to elucidate the potential variants on the data extraction error rates. Eligible 90 participants would be 2nd year or above post-graduate students (e.g., masters, doctoral program). Participants will be randomized to one of the two groups to complete pre-defined data extraction tasks: 1) group A will contain 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmaceutical interventions; 2) group B will contain 10 RCTs of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Participants who finish the data extraction would then be assigned to the alternative group for another round of data extraction after a 30 min washout period. Finally, those participants assigned to A or B group will be further 1:1 randomly matched based on a random-sequenced number for the double-checking process on the extracted data. The primary outcome will be the data extract error rates of the pharmaceutical intervention group and non-pharmaceutical group, before the double-checking process, in terms of the cell level, study level, and participant level. The secondary outcome will be the data error rates of the pharmaceutical intervention group and non-pharmaceutical group after the double-checking process, again, in terms of the cell level, study level, and participant level. A generalized linear mixed effects model (based on the above three levels) will be used to estimate the potential differences in the error rates, with a log link function for binomial data. Subgroup analyses will account for the experience of individuals on systematic reviews and the time used for the data extraction.This trial will provide useful evidence for further systematic review of data extraction practices, improved data extraction strategies, and better guidelines.Chinese Clinical Trial Register Center (Identifier: ChiCTR2200062206).

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objective was to investigate the role of duet extraction in reducing data errors in evidence synthesis for pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Design Randomized controlled trial. Setting University teaching center and hospital evidence-based medicine center. Participants Eligible 100 participants were 2 nd year or above post-graduate students (e.g., masters, doctoral program), who were randomly (1:1) assigned for data extraction tasks of either 10 RCTs of pharmaceutical interventions or 10 of non-pharmaceutical interventions, followed by a cross-over pattern and a further double-checking process. Intervention The intervention of this trial was double-checking process for data extraction. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the error rates for RCTs in the pharmaceutical versus non-pharmaceutical intervention group, in terms of both study level and cell level (2 by 2 table). The secondary outcome was the absolute difference in the error rates before and after the double-checking process for both the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical intervention groups, again, in terms of both study level and cell level (2 by 2 table). Results The error rates in RCTs of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical groups were 64.65% and 59.90%, with an absolute difference of 4.75% and an odds ratio (OR) of 1.29 (95%CI: 1.06 to 1.57, P = 0.01) when measured at the study level. After double-checking, the error rates decreased to 44.88% and 39.54%, and the difference between the two groups remained at 5.34%, with the OR of 1.27 (95%CI: 1.1 to 1.46; P &lt; 0.01). Similar results were observed when measured at the cell level. Conclusion Double-checking reduced data extraction errors, but the error rate still remained high after the process. Further evidence synthesis research may consider to use triple data extraction to minimize potential errors. Trial registration number Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Center (Identifier: ChiCTR2200062206) Strengths and limitations of the study This is the third randomized trial focusing on data extraction strategies and the first one in the Asia-Pacific region. This is the first randomized trial that compares error rates of data extraction in trials of pharmaceutical interventions and non-pharmaceutical interventions. We validated the effectiveness of dual data extraction while also identifying its limitations, providing valuable evidence for future data extraction strategies. To ensure the feasibility of the trial, we restricted subjects to 2 nd post-graduate students or above, which may affects the representativeness of the sample. The readability of the chosen randomized controlled trials for pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions may vary, potentially resulting in selection bias that can distort the outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background Data extraction is the foundation for research synthesis evidence, and it is often time- and labor-consuming, and prone to errors. Whilst data extraction errors frequently occur in the literature, an interesting phenomenon was observed that data extraction error tend to be more common in trials of pharmaceutical interventions compared to non-pharmaceutical ones. This phenomenon has not been verified by high-quality evidence, the elucidation of which would have implications for guidelines, practice, and policy. Methods and analyses We propose a crossover, multicenter, investigator-blinded, trial to elucidate the potential variants on the data extraction error rates of meta-analyses with pharmaceutical against non-pharmaceutical interventions. Eligible 90 participants would be 2 nd year or above post-graduate students (e.g., masters, doctoral program). Participants will be randomized to one of the two groups to complete pre-defined data extraction tasks: 1) group A will contain 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmaceutical interventions; 2) group B will contain 10 RCTs of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Participants would then be assigned to the alternative group for another round of data extraction, after a 30 mins washout period. Finally, those participants assigned to A or B group will be further 1:1 randomly matched based on a random-sequenced number, for the double-checking process on the extracted data. The primary outcome will be the data extract error rates of pharmaceutical intervention group and non-pharmaceutical group, before the double-checking process, in terms of the cell level, study level, and participant level. The secondary outcome will be the data error error rates of pharmaceutical intervention group and non-pharmaceutical group, after the double-checking process, again, in terms of the cell level, study level, and participant level. Generalized linear mixed effects model (based on the above three levels) will be used to estimate the potential differences in the error rates, with a log link function for binomial data. Subgroup analyses will account for the following factors i.e., the experience of individuals on systematic reviews, and the time used for the data extraction. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the institutional review board of Anhui Medical University (No.83220405). Findings of the study will be presented at international scientific meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed academic journal. Trial registration Chinese Clinical Trial Register Center (Identifier: ChiCTR2200062206). Strengths and limitations of the study This will be the first trial to compare data extraction error rates in pharmaceutical intervention and non-pharmaceutical intervention studies for research synthesis. This will be the third randomized trial on the strategy of data extraction in the world and the first in the Asia-Pacific region. The use of a crossover design provides a valid way to reduce the potential impact of heterogeneous contexts of the studies and thus is expected to provide robust evidence to support better evidence synthesis practice. We will restrict the participants to 2 nd year post-graduate students or above to ensure the feasibility of the trial; this restriction will no doubt impact the representativeness of the samples. A group of useful strategies (eg. use U disk and isolate signal etc.) should be taken to minimize the impact of the possible sharing of the completed extraction table among the participants.

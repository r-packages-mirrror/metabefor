```{r}

rxsFile_with_errors <-
  system.file(
    "extdata",
    "rxs-with-errors",
    "rxs_minimal_example_module2--erroneous_2.rxs.Rmd",

  );

```

The R chunk above locates an R Extraction Script file (Rxs file) that is included with the `{metabefor}` package and that contains errors. This file is then included below. To view the raw R Extraction Script, follow [this link](https://gitlab.com/r-packages/metabefor/-/blob/main/inst/extdata/rxs-with-errors/rxs_minimal_example_module2--erroneous_2.rxs.Rmd).

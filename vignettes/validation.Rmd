```{r, include = FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)

rxsFile_with_errors <-
  system.file(
    "extdata",
    "extraction-examples-with-errors",
    "rxs_minimal_example_module2--erroneous_2.rxs.Rmd",
    package = "metabefor"
  );

```

The R chunk above locates an R Extraction Script file (Rxs file) that is included with the `{metabefor}` package and that contains errors. This file is then included below.

```{r, child=rxsFile_with_errors}
```

This vignette is an introduction to metabefor, mostly serving to point you to the main `metabefor` resources. Three such resources exist.

First, of course, there is the manual as included with the package. From within R, each function's manual page can be displayed by prepending the function name with a question mark (e.g. `?metabefor::rxs_fromSpecifications`. Alternatively, the index of functions is available at the `metabefor` PkgDown site http://r-packages.gitlab.io/metabefor.

Second, there is the SysRevving book, available at https://sysrevving.com. This living open access book is intended as a general resource on conducting systematic reviews, built around `metabefor`.

Third, there is NITRO, the Narrated Illustration of a Transparent Review Outline. This is somewhat of a worked example, available at https://sci-ops.gitlab.io/narrated-illustration-of-a-transparent-review-outline.

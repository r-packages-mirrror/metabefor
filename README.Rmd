In systematic reviews, extracting data from primary sources is a
crucial step with a high potential for introduction of biases. This
package facilitates specification of R extraction scripts that are
simultaneously human- and machine-readable. In addition, they are
modular and extensible, lending themselves well to living reviews
where insights as to optimal extraction evolve over time. By being
R Markdown script files, they are optimally transparant, and their
structure was designed to also be accessible to readers without R.
Finally, each extraction script contains the original
specification, enabling bootstrapping new specifications from each
single extraction script.

Originally, the package was intended to help with everything that needs to be done before the [metafor](https://metafor-project.org) package can be used, hence the name. Since then, the [metaverse](https://rmetaverse.github.io/) was born, with dedicated packages for specific stages, such as developing search strategies, working with bibliographic data, and visualisation. Presently, therefore, `metabefor` mostly covers extraction.

## Getting started

Eventually, the best place to get started will be the [SysRevving](https://sysrevving.com) book. However, as yet that is still very much in its early stages. For now, the following pages form a good starting point:

1. The [Planning](https://sysrevving.com/planning) chapter in the SysRevving book (in progress)
2. The [Extraction](https://sysrevving.com/extraction) chapter in the SysRevving book (in progress)
3. The [R Extraction Scripts](http://r-packages.gitlab.io/metabefor/articles/r-extraction-scripts.html) vignette (in progress)
4. The [Definitions](http://r-packages.gitlab.io/metabefor/articles/definitions.html) vignette (in progress)

## Installation

You can install the released version of ``r packagename`` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment="", results="asis"}
cat(paste0("``` r
install.packages('", packagename, "');
```"));
```

You can install the development version of ``r packagename`` from [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) with:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment="", results="asis"}
cat(paste0("``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/", packagename, "@main');
```"));
```

(assuming you have `remotes` installed; otherwise, install that first using the `install.packages` function)

<!-- You can install the cutting edge development version (own risk, don't try this at home, etc)  of ``r packagename`` from [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) with: -->

```{r echo=FALSE, comment="", results="asis", include=FALSE}
cat(paste0("``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/", packagename, "@dev');
```"));
```

## Getting started

The SysRevving book may be a good place to get started (like this package, still under development): https://sysrevving.com.

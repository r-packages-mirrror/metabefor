In systematic reviews, extracting data from primary sources is a
crucial step with a high potential for introduction of biases. This
package facilitates specification of R extraction scripts that are
simultaneously human- and machine-readable. In addition, they are
modular and extensible, lending themselves well to living reviews
where insights as to optimal extraction evolve over time. By being
R Markdown script files, they are optimally transparant, and their
structure was designed to also be accessible to readers without R.
Finally, each extraction script contains the original
specification, enabling bootstrapping new specifications from each
single extraction script.

Originally, the package was intended to help with everything that needs to be done before the [metafor](https://metafor-project.org) package can be used, hence the name. Since then, the [metaverse](https://rmetaverse.github.io/) was born, with dedicated packages for specific stages, such as developing search strategies, working with bibliographic data, and visualisation. Presently, therefore, `metabefor` mostly covers extraction.

## Getting started

Depending on your situation there are three places to get started.

If you're already familiar with systematic reviews and evidence synthesis, you may want to start with NITRO, the Narrated Illustration of a Transparent Review Outline. This is somewhat of a worked example, available at https://sci-ops.gitlab.io/narrated-illustration-of-a-transparent-review-outline.

Second, if you're relatively new to systematic reviews, you may want to start with the SysRevving book, available at https://sysrevving.com. This living open access book is intended as a general resource on conducting systematic reviews, built around `metabefor`.

Third, if you're already using `metabefor`, you may just want to consult the manual as included with the package. From within R, each function's manual page can be displayed by prepending the function name with a question mark (e.g. `?metabefor::rxs_fromSpecifications`. Alternatively, the index of functions is available at the `metabefor` PkgDown site http://r-packages.gitlab.io/metabefor.

Finally, in any case you may want to keep the glossary of terms ready. This is located at https://sysrevving.com/glossary.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ``r packagename`` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment="", results="asis"}
cat(paste0("``` r
install.packages('", packagename, "');
```"));
```

You can install the development version of ``r packagename`` from [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) with:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment="", results="asis"}
cat(paste0("``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/", packagename, "@main');
```"));
```

(assuming you have `remotes` installed; otherwise, install that first using the `install.packages` function)

<!-- You can install the cutting edge development version (own risk, don't try this at home, etc)  of ``r packagename`` from [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) with: -->

```{r echo=FALSE, comment="", results="asis", include=FALSE}
cat(paste0("``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/", packagename, "@dev');
```"));
```
